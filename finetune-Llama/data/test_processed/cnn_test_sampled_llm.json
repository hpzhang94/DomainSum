-- a time when latinos will show up at the polls in droves and transform the political landscape .\npresident obama 's renewed push last week for immigration reform has brought with it fresh expectations for the latino vote in november 's midterm elections .\nthe issue is considered one of symbolic and substantive importance for the community .\nfour out of five undocumented immigrants are from mexico or another part of latin america , according to the pew hispanic center .\nwhile voter turnout among the latino community has risen in recent years , the adage that there 's \" strength in numbers \" has yet to manifest itself . \"\nhispanics are not punching at their weight , \" said mark hugo lopez , associate director of the pew hispanic center . \"\ntheir share of voters does n't quite match their share in the general population . \"\nbut if mobilization efforts change that , the group could be a key voice in november .\na study from the pro-immigration reform group america 's voice suggests that latinos could play a key role in 37 congressional races .\nvoter participation is down across the board in midterm elections , but among latinos , turnout is especially unpredictable right now , said antonio gonzalez , president of the william c. velasquez institute , a public policy analysis group . \"\ngoing into 2010 and 2012 , there is a big question mark on latino behavior , \" he said . \"\nlatinos have suffered so badly from the economic depression .\nlatinos are very angry about the immigration debate , and we 're getting killed in home foreclosures . \"\nat 15.8 percent of the population , latinos constitute the largest minority group in the united states .\nafrican-americans make up 12.3 percent of the u.s. population , according to the census bureau .\nin 2008 , turnout for black voters was 65.2 percent and 67.2 percent for white voters .\nfor latinos , turnout was 49.9 percent , according to pew .\nbut the numbers do n't tell the whole story , experts said . \"\nthe issue is not that latinos are disinterested in politics , \" said david leal , an associate professor of government who focuses on latino politics at the university of texas at austin . \"\ninstead , latino turnout reflects the larger underlying factors that structure the vote for everyone . \"\nthe main factors affecting turnout among latinos apply to all racial and ethnic groups : many are under the age of 18 , and many occupy relatively low rungs on the educational and occupational ladders .\nno matter what one 's ethnicity , those determinants will have a negative impact on turnout , leal said .\nlatino influence in elections , however , has seen a steady increase over the past 20 years .\nparticipation in 2008 was up 2.7 percent from the 2004 election , and is growing faster than any other group .\ngonzalez said there are two reasons for the upward march : latinos are the fastest-growing group demographically , and for the past generation , there 's been a strong push to improve participation .\nstill , he said , claims that latinos played a major role in swinging the presidential election for obama were \" over-reported . \"\nlatinos have a solid enough population to swing state and local elections , but \" latinos alone ca n't swing presidential elections , \" he said .\nobama captured about 67 percent of the latino vote in 2008 , compared with president bush 's 44 percent in 2004 .\nleal said people tend to overestimate the influence of the latino vote when they focus on population growth . \"\nwhile latinos may be the largest and fastest-growing minority group , the key word in that description is minority , \" he said . \"\nthe best way to assess their political influence is probably not whether they are regularly deciding presidential elections . \"\nin 2008 , latinos were more a part of a winning coalition for obama than they were responsible for swinging it for him , leal said . \"\nthey may have made the difference in a few closely divided states , but when states are that closely divided , many groups can probably claim credit , \" he added .\nas the latino vote grows , so do efforts to court the community .\ncandidates zigzag through districts to woo voters , but they often end up insulting them instead , said marytza sanz , president of latino leadership inc . \"\nyou come and talk piñata politics .\nyou speak spanish .\nyou have arroz con pollo and then you drink cafe con leche -- and you think you already know my community , \" sanz said .\nyou have arroz con pollo and then you drink

.\nwe need to purchase homes , we need good health care , we need good roads , good schools , \" she added .\nlatinos on the whole lean liberal , but for the most part , the community views the policy agenda the same way as other groups , leal said . \"\nit has not been the case that latinos rank issues such as bilingual education , immigration reform and affirmative action as the most important in america .\nlatinos have generally prioritized the same basic issues that everyone else sees as important , \" he said .\na pew study released before the 2008 presidential election indicated that latinos placed immigration second to last on a list of seven policy priorities .\nthe economy , education and health care were ranked as far more important .\nbut in the months since arizona passed an immigration law that critics say could lead to racial profiling , more recent surveys have indicated that the issue has risen to the top for latinos .\na survey commissioned by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials indicates that the immigration debate has made latinos more likely to vote in november .\nin a high profile speech last week , obama called on congress to take action on the issue , but several senior democratic sources told cnn that they still see virtually no chance of congress taking up immigration reform before the midterm elections .\nstill , the sources said it was politically crucial for the president to give such a speech to put pressure on republicans and reassure angry latino voters that democrats have n't forgotten about this issue .\nin addition to being an important substantive issue for latinos , immigration is also considered a \" symbolic issue of significant importance , \" said david ayón , a political analyst and senior research associate at the leavey center for the study of los angeles at loyola marymount university . \"\nthat 's the subtext to the whole immigration issue in washington .\nwill latinos turn out for obama 's re-election the way they did for his election ? \"\nhe asked .\ngonzalez said the obama administration is supported by latinos , but the community also is expecting something in return for its vote . \"\nlatino voters are not like independents who go back and forth .\n... they do n't swing republican .\nthey get mad and stay home , \" he said .\nand unless the party in power

missing plane multinational search for missing plane editor 's note : robert goyer is the editor-in-chief of flying magazine and a commercial jet-rated pilot .\n( cnn ) -- flight mh-370 may go down in history as one of most incredible aviation mysteries .\nthe cruel reality is that even though we have a fair amount of information now , we still know so little .\nmalaysian prime minister najib razak informed the families of the victims that the plane had crashed into the remote south indian ocean , and all 239 people onboard are presumed dead .\nthat tragic but not unexpected conclusion was based on data analysis by satellite company inmarsat , which malaysia now says was able to track flight 370 until the signal ended very near where searchers are now hunting for plane wreckage .\nthe location tells a lot about what might have happened to the doomed flight while telling us not a single detail about why it crashed .\nthe presumed location of the wreckage makes it all but impossible for certain scenarios to have played out as many observers insisted they must have .\nthe first thing to understand is altitude is everything .\na turbofan powered jet like the boeing 777-200er relies on altitude to make good on its ultra long-range capabilities .\nat its normal cruising altitudes from around 35,000 to 40,000 feet , the 777 can fly very long distances , in excess of 11,000 miles .\nbut it seldom flies long routes .\nflight 370 search unites global community on its trip from kuala lumpur to beijing , the plane would have had , according to investigators ' projections , around seven hours of total endurance at a normal cruising speed of around 600 mph -- just enough to have flown its suspected flight path north for 40 minutes , west for around that much time again , and then south for many hours .\nat lower altitudes , turbofan engines like the rolls-royce engines on the malaysia airlines airplane , burn substantially more fuel than they do at typical cruise altitudes -- as much as twice depending on the altitudes one uses for comparison .\nthe increase in fuel burn will greatly reduce range , making it impossible for flight mh-370 to have reached the southern indian ocean at a low altitude .\nit would need to have flown at a much higher optimum altitude in order to make it that far .\npilots can reduce the power to cut back on fuel flow , of course , but that also reduces airspeed , which again reduces range .\nthere 's no winning when it comes to flying a turbofan-powered airplane : if you want to fly far , you need to fly high .\nso the fuel required for mh-370 to have reached the presumed crash location around 1500 miles west of perth , australia , means that the airplane did not do a lot of climbing or descending after it deviated from its original planned route to beijing while it was still an hour or so north of kuala lumpur .\nso if there was a struggle for control of the flight -- whether it was mechanical issues or a hijacker -- it could not have lasted long or involved great altitude deviations .\nthis means it 's hard , though not impossible , to explain the disappearance as being the result of a mechanical or electrical failure .\nsuch a scenario , as i 've been saying since the beginning of the mystery , would require a kind of mechanical magic bullet , an event that would have taken out the transponder and acars radio , as well as the voice communications radios .\nwhy else would they not have communicated the emergency ?\npilot : how mechanical problem could have downed flight 370 then one must accept that such a failure chain could then allow the crew -- or skilled intruder -- to be able to drive the airplane around the sky for a protracted period of time , eventually pointing it south , in the opposite direction from where the airplane was originally headed .\nlet 's remember , too , that the airplane would have to maintain an altitude sufficient to allow it to reach the southern indian ocean .\nall this must also have left the 777 in good enough shape to fly for another six hours or so before crashing .\na failure of the pressurization system might account for the scenario , but only if the pilots completely mismanaged their response to the emergency .\nthe 777 's backup and emergency oxygen systems are just as intelligently designed as the rest of the jet 's redundant systems .\nit 's also difficult , if not impossible , to explain how the jet could have made the turns it did if the crew were unconscious during that time .\nwere they desperately trying to find an airport before time ran out ?\nif so , they would have done two things they did n't do : they would have communicated the emergency and they would have descended .\nneither of those things happened .\nwhile it 's horrific to imagine , a botched hijacking or failed pilot commandeering of the airplane are still the most likely scenarios .\nonly when searchers have located and recovered the wreckage , as we all desperately hope they do , will we have our first good clues to what have might have unfolded on malaysia airlines flight mh-370 .\nfollow us on twitter @cnnopinion .\nthe

{"document": "updated 3:12 pm est , tue february 4 , 2014 people waiting on line at a job fair .\neditor 's note : daniel j. mitchell is an economist and senior fellow at the cato institute , a libertarian think tank based in washington .\n( cnn ) -- president barack obama announced that 300 companies -- including apple , wal-mart and others -- have signed a pledge to help the long-term unemployed by making sure they do n't have barriers in their hiring practices .\nthis is good news , but it wo n't solve the problem .\nthe best we can hope for is that the companies now will make special efforts to seek out and employ those who have suffered long-term joblessness .\nthat 's a nice start , but feel-good gestures wo n't cut it when there are almost 4 million americans who have been out of work for more than six months .\nthat 's a big number .\nwhat 's disconcerting is that the current long-term unemployment is more serious than in previous economic downturns .\ndata from previous business cycles show people suffering from long-run joblessness at worst accounted for about 20 % to 25 % of the unemployed .\nin recent months , that percentage has jumped to nearly 40 % -- an all-time record !\nindeed , america is beginning to look like europe .\nit used to be that long-term unemployment in the u.s. was only a fraction of europe 's , but the latest data from the organization for economic cooperation and development show that the united states has caught up to many of europe 's welfare states .\nthat 's not a race we want to be part of , much less win .\nthere 's no silver bullet , but economic growth is the single most important key .\nall forms of unemployment get worse when the economy is weak .\nbut when the economy is booming , the job market gets better for everybody -- including those who have been unemployed for long periods .\nunfortunately , economic growth has n't proven easy .\nthe recession may have ended officially in the summer of 2009 , but we 're still suffering through a sluggish economic cycle .\nrecent improvements in the overall employment rate are in large part the result of people dropping out of the labor force , and the problem of long-run unemployment has barely budged .\nto boost employment , we need the kind of strong growth america enjoyed during the reagan and clinton years , when millions of new jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell dramatically .\nto get there , we need a return to the types of free-market policies we got under reagan and clinton : a lower burden of government spending and less intervention from washington .\nunfortunately , we 've been moving in the exact opposite direction .\nunder both presidents bush and clinton , the size and scope of government has expanded , and the united states -- which had the world 's third-most free-market economy when bill clinton left office -- has now dropped to 17th in the economic freedom of the world rankings .\nwe also need to make sure the unemployed do n't get lured into long-term dependency .\none glaring example of misguided big-government policy is the argument to endlessly extend unemployment benefits .\nthat sounds compassionate , but according to economists such policies discourage the unemployed from aggressively seeking new jobs .\nthere is also persuasive evidence that employers are reluctant to hire people ( regardless of any \" pledges \" they may sign ) who have been out of work for lengthy periods , which makes the president 's preferred approach of more unemployment benefits akin to an overprotective parent who hinders a child 's development .\nmoreover , obama 's proposed hike in the minimum wage would actually counteract any good his pledge would do .\nwhy ?\nincreasing the minimum wage is the equivalent of sawing off the bottom rungs on the economic ladder .\nsimply stated , businesses create jobs when they think a new employee will help the bottom line .\nartificially raising the cost of workers -- particularly those with marginal skills -- is a recipe for creating more unemployment .\nthe president 's effort to get companies on board with hiring the long-term unemployed should be applauded , but he should n't for one second think that it will solve the problem .\nin fact , too many of his other proposals would serve only to exacerbate the problem the long-term unemployed are facing .\ninstead , obama should take a page out of the reagan and clinton presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment : economic growth .\nfollow us on twitter @cnnopinion .\nthe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of daniel j. mitchell .", "summary": "daniel mitchell says it 's a nice gesture that 300 companies pledged to help the long-term unemployed , but that 's not enough ."}

{"document": "ralph friedgen , 63 , was forced out at maryland despite winning acc coach of the year honors this season .\ngenerally speaking , there 's only one thing a head coach must do to keep his job : win .\nbut if the 2010-11 coaching carousel has taught us anything , it 's that some athletic directors are adding a caveat : win , and do n't be old .\nover the past week , new athletic directors at west virginia and maryland forced out incumbent coaches who , by most reasonable standards , had been relatively successful .\nmountaineers coach bill stewart , 58 , has won nine games in each of his first three seasons .\nterrapins coach ralph friedgen , 63 , has taken his team to seven bowl games in 10 years and was named the acc 's coach of the year this season .\nwest virginia ad oliver luck , who started on the job last june , is taking the program in a new and indisputably odd direction .\nhe 's bringing in highly regarded oklahoma state offensive coordinator dana holgorsen , an acquaintance from when both were working in houston a couple years ago .\nin a nov. 14 meeting , luck gave stewart two choices : resign after this year , or resign after next .\nstewart chose option b , so holgorsen will serve as his forced-upon offensive coordinator in 2011 . \"\nbecause of [ stewart 's ] professionalism , i have all the confidence in the world that our transition year will work very smoothly , \" said luck .\nmaryland ad kevin anderson , meanwhile , inherited an admittedly awkward situation when he arrived in september .\npredecessor debbie yow had locked in offensive coordinator james franklin to be friedgen 's successor by 2012 , well before the terps endured a 2-10 season last year .\nmaryland jumped back up to 8-4 this fall , but when franklin accepted vanderbilt 's head coaching job last week , it opened the door for anderson to hire any coach he wanted .\nas franklin packed his bags for nashville , anderson asked friedgen to retire .\nfriedgen refused , so the school bought out the last year of his contract . \"\n[ friedgen ] made it very clear he did n't want to be a lame-duck coach , \" said anderson . \"\ni was looking to move the program in a different direction , and i was n't willing to give him a contract extension . \"\nit 's widely believed that maryland is looking to pounce on free-agent mike leach , the former texas tech coach who happens to be close friends with one of the terps ' most influential boosters , under armour ceo kevin plank .\nleach has expressed interest , and anderson admitted leach is \" on the list . \"\nleach , 49 , is 14 years younger than the man he 'd be replacing .\nwest virginia hire holgorsen , 39 , is nearly two decades younger than stewart .\n( coincidentally , holgorsen is a former leach protégé , having worked under him for a combined 11 years at valdosta state and texas tech . )\nin that respect , maryland and west virginia are merely following the national trend in coaching hires : youth and energy trump age and experience .\npittsburgh recently replaced 58-year-old dave wannstedt , an nfl and college head coach for 17 seasons , with 46-year-old michael haywood , a head coach for two seasons at miami ( ohio ) .\ncolorado axed dan hawkins , 50 , who 's been a head coach for 15 seasons , and hired redskins tight ends coach jon embree , 45 , a cu alum who 'd never previously served as even an offensive coordinator .\nnew florida coach will muschamp is a 39-year-old first time head coach .\nindiana ( kevin wilson ) and vanderbilt ( franklin ) went with first-time head coaches , too .\nfranklin , 38 , is 18 years younger than robbie caldwell , the man he replaced .\nin fact , all eight bcs-conference hires to date are younger than the coaches they 're replacing .\n>> keep track of all the 2010-11 coaching changes it 's not hard to see why the sport is headed in this direction .\none need only look at the upcoming bcs national championship game participants , auburn and oregon .\ntigers coach gene chizik , 48 , was hired largely off his successful stints as defensive coordinator at auburn and texas .\n( he spent two losing seasons as head coach at iowa state . )\noregon 's chip kelly , 47 , was just two years removed from serving as new hampshire 's offensive coordinator when the school nudged out 14-year coach mike bellotti to promote kelly .\nanother bcs bowl coach , wisconsin 's bret bielema , was a 35-year-old defensive coordinator when then-coach barry alvarez anointed bielema to be his successor five years ago . \"\nwisconsin and oregon -- programs that we want to model ourselves after -- they are today two of the most successful programs in the country , \" said luck . \"\nthe model that is ... almost exactly like ours is at the university of wisconsin , back in 2005-06 , when [ alvarez ] segued out in favor of [ bielema ] . \"\nluck left out a few important details .\nunlike stewart and holgorsen , alvarez hired bielema from kansas state to be his defensive coordinator .\nbielema spent a year in madison before being dubbed \" head coach in waiting \" and then another year apprenticing .\nstewart had never met holgorsen before being told by his boss he was getting a new offensive coordinator .\nwest virginia 's bill stewart will serve as a lame duck coach in 2011 before passing the reins to dana holgorsen in 2012 .\nluck was more candid in explaining the reasons behind pushing out stewart . \"\ni did n't believe we had an opportunity to win a national championship with the direction of the program , \" he said .\nfair enough .\nmost of us felt the same way about the congenial west virginian from the day he was hastily promoted from interim coach following the mountaineers ' fiesta bowl upset of oklahoma .\nbut if national championships are the standard in morgantown , every other coach before stewart -- including revered hall of famer don nehlen -- was also a failure , because west virginia has never won one .\napparently luck believes the one to pull it off is holgorsen , an eccentric leach-like figure ( he lived in a hotel during his 11 months in stillwater ) who engineered the nation 's most productive offense each of the past two seasons at houston and oklahoma state .\nwest virginia is just three years removed from a bcs bowl appearance and shared this year 's big east title , but luck believed the program had lost its sizzle . \"\nour season ticket base has declined from stewart 's first year to the present time , \" said luck . \"\nwe 've had only two crowds since 2004 under 50,000 , and both of those took place in the last couple of years .\nthat to me is an indication that our fans are n't satisfied with the product . \"\nmaryland had a similar but more drastic problem .\nwith the enthusiasm of friedgen 's early tenure ( three straight 10-win seasons from 2001-03 ) a distant memory , the terps averaged just 39,168 per game this year at 54,000-seat byrd stadium .\non the field maryland showed considerable promise , led by freshman quarterback danny o'brien , the acc 's rookie of the year .\nbut with several assistants expected to follow franklin to

the information sticks better , perhaps because listeners are forced to change their perspectives on the original premise .\nstudies have shown that elementary and high school students can recall a humor-filled presentation more easily .\nkatz 's work is testament to the power of such presentations .\nin 2006 , he put together an idea for media executive tom freston , who had just agreed to appear at a comedy roast when he was fired from his job as viacom ceo for , among other things , not buying myspace .\nkatz had great fun with al gore 's stiff public image , and gore used the lines to mock himself .\nfreston was trying to back out of the speech , but katz -- who had never met him -- pitched him an idea that imagined him as an internet simpleton who 'd just discovered the computer .\nfreston , in golly-gee mode , stood up in front of his colleagues and talked about how he 'd finally purchased a machine and was pleased to finally see what all the myspace fuss was about . \"\nit was as brave as anything you 'd ever seen , \" says katz . \"\nhere was a guy who 'd just gotten kicked to the curb in a very public way , and three weeks later he 's giving the funniest speech anyone can remember seeing . \"\nkatz thinks of such episodes as \" self-administered tests of character . \"\n( freston was vindicated : myspace struggled mightily , and was finally sold by its purchaser , news corp. , for a fraction of its original price . )\nthe white house could be even more challenging . \"\neverybody is an expert , \" says katz . \"\neverybody is their own focus group .\n... you 've got a half-dozen people who can write a good joke , and 50 people who can kill it . \"\nhe remembers walking miles of washington hallways , pacing and pondering .\nthe continual crises did n't make the job any easier . \"\nwe used to talk about it in terms of ' lancing the boil , ' \" says shesol , who joined the administration in 1998 just as the monica lewinsky scandal broke .\nlaughter was in desperate need by that time .\nthe white house was like \" a bunker guarded by lawyers , \" katz says .\nstill , if anything , the urgent atmosphere of the white house gave katz and other members of the \" comedy war room \" opportunities to be creative . \"\nwe could do jokes about the smoke but not the fire . \"\nduring the impeachment process , \" there was nothing to guide us , \" he adds . \"\nthe last president to be impeached was andrew johnson , and his joke writer kept very poor notes . \"\nclinton survived , of course , and by the time of the 1999 radio-television correspondents dinner -- which took place just after clinton was acquitted -- katz , shesol and the other speech contributors were feeling \" fearless , \" katz recalls .\nthe president had not just ticked off his enemies by escaping conviction ; he had infuriated his supporters , and many in the white house itself , by violating their faith . \"\nthe feeling was , a joke ca n't hurt us . \"\nit was n't easy .\nkatz remembers spending two days in a room with shesol , bouncing ideas off each other .\nbut it led to a decidedly contrite clinton still getting the last laugh : \" the events of the last year have been quite serious .\nif the senate vote had gone the other way , i would n't be here , \" he began , facing a crowd of 2,000 journalists , many of whom had covered the process with particularly sharp writing instruments .\nthere was a pause , then : \" i demand a recount . \"\n\" there 's an answer to just about every problem , \" katz says now . \"\nthese speeches are always kind of the struggle to find the right comic retort to that moment in time , and some are tougher than others . \"\nhumor is your friend -- usually clinton was , in many ways , an ideal speaker .\nhe presented his material confidently , rarely revealing his anger or hurt .\nhis timing was impeccable .\nkatz , shesol and katz 's friend phil rosenthal -- best known as the creator of \" everybody loves raymond \" -- decided to give the president a royal send-off , creating a film called \" the final days \" that showed the lonely president , abandoned by his senate-pursuing wife and presidency-pursuing vice-president , roping staffers into a variety of activities .\nit 's the kind of tactic that won over even clinton 's opponents -- and it 's a strategy any president should keep in mind , says delaware 's young .\ntake barack obama .\nhe 's appeared on both \" the daily show , \" which plays to a younger , more left-leaning crowd , as well as jay leno 's older-skewing \" tonight show . \"\nit was my job to say , ' how do you solve this problem using humor ?

our right to choose whether or not we want health insurance .\nand do n't give me that line about mandatory auto insurance because that is only if you choose to drive an auto .\nthe bill should be repealed .\ni do n't just \" guess \" i 'm disappointed the bill passed , i know i 'm disappointed .\noh my god , what an idea , healthcare for everyone !!!\n... but wait a minute , that is such a

did she get coverage ?\noh yeah , she was on fox , and cnn covers whatever republican families say on fox .\nthat 's why we hear liz cheney spout her family 's vicious insanity and why we never hear from chelsea clinton .\nthis just shows there is a disconnect from reality with the younger generations .\ni am disappointed with barbara bush 's comments .\nevidently she does not realize that she and her generation will be the ones bearing the brunt of obamacare 's cost .\nno one who lives in the us is entitled to free healthcare .... the constitution does not guarantee that to any citizen .\nwhat the younger generations needs to realize is that all of the freebies that obama is giving to them will need to be paid for starting in 2014 .... after the re-election in 2012 .\nthere is nothing in life that is free .\nwe all will have to pay more taxes for this stupid law .\nplus our healthcare will not get better , only worse .\nall you have to do is hold a conversation with someone

needing therapy to deal with it .\nbb just went up a notch in my book .\nthat puts her at notch 1 .\ni 'm glad she stood up for her principles .\nof course , now she 'll be shunned by the rest of the gop because she did n't follow party lines and * dared * to think for herself .\nhey rush limbaugh , did you hear that ?\nha !\nit 's obvious that miss bush has a higher intellect and more empathy for the common american citizen than her father or her father 's republican party has .\ndaddy has probably already called her and told her to shut up .\nthis barbara is a nice girl , not like all the other republicans who want health care only for the rich .\nsomewhere , dick cheney is having another heart attack wow !\nso somebody that does n't know nothing about healthcare thinks it should have

capable of spawning bright compassionate people .\nof course , there are those who think folks on \" lower salaries \" should n't have health care ..... if you 're poor and have a chronic illness , just take an aspirin .\nunlike sara palin , the bush daughter is sensible .\nsince he retired , we are finding more evidence that george bush might be the least intelligent member of his immediate family .\nw 's daughter speaks the truth .\ngood for her .\nwell at least the final bill did n't have a public option or those back-room favors for a handful of states .\nobama learned the same lesson clinton had to learn when he was first elected .\njust because you 're in the white house does n't mean you 're going to dictate how legislation will come down , even with a supermajority .\ni know it 's hard for conservatives to see it , but they won some important victories along the way that kept the bill from being a lot more expensive .\nthis is america – we have freedom to express our thoughts & beliefs no matter where our party allegiance is .\nkudos to barbara !\nobviously , barbara bush is better educated and smarter than her dimwit dad and the morons in the gop .\ni love barbara bush jr. !\nthank you , barbara .\nyou are a wonderful example of how someone does n't have to tow the party line and can actually care about another human being . \"\nwhy do , basically ,

lack of honesty , lack of character , lack of disipline , lack of family , lack of religion , lack of a conscience are the reasons why people do not succeed .\nthe government can not provide all those things , you need to learn them and keep them yourself .\nwell obviously , she like most of the rest of humanity , including obama , did not read the bill .\ni amazes me how these people can make a comment on something they have no knowledge of .\ni guess that 's why they call them democrats .\nfinally a bush with some common sense .\nit is refreshing to see that all republicans are not sticking to the same old talking points !\ngood for your barbara bush !\nthe idiot did n't fall far from the idiot tree .\nsomeone with the last name bush and has that dna in her veins has common sense ?\nthe same question was asked about education many many years ago .\nhmmm ... the lunacy stopped with her dad then .\nthank goodness .\nthis is president obama base – the young republicans and democrates .\nthey do not think like their parents and are move compassion toward the poor .\npresident obama needs to keep the young happen and he will win in 2012 .\nlet 's see , barbara likes healthcare for everyone , her mom says gay people should have the same marriage rights as other americans .\nhmmm , maybe if republicans acted a little more like human beings and americans who stick up for each other and not just tow the party line the gop might not be in so much trouble .\nbut i do n't think we have to worry about that happening .\ngood for her !\nshows she has a mind of her own and can stand up for what she believes iin .\nthe girl 's got a heart !\nshe must take after george h.w.\n's side of the family .\nafter all , he did yearn for a kinder , gentler nation ; and was promptly considered a \" wimp \" by gop power guys , even though he was a wwii volunteer fighter ; unlike many of them . \"\nhealth should be a right for everyone . \"\nyeah , everyone does have a \" right \" to health , a right complimented by everyone 's own personal responsibility to maintain it .\nbut no one has a \" right \" to raid the public treasury – i.e.\n, their neighbour 's wallets – to pay their own medical bills . \"\nwhy do , basically , people with money have good health care and why do people who live on lower salaries not have good health care ? \"\nbecause people with more money can afford better stuff .\npeople with more money can afford nicer cars and bigger houses – and better medical care .\ngood for her .\ndid gw bush actually do something well and raise independent , intelligent daughters ?\nwow !\nthe only smart bush in the bunch .\nmaybe she 's adopted ?\ni 'm hardcore dem , but i got ta say , w. ca n't be that bad of a guy given his wife and daughters .\n( and for the record , i 've always liked laura & the girls , long before they began sharing their support for kagan and health care ) .\ncome on now .\ni saw the entire interview .\ncnn is making it sound like barbarba bush endorsed the obama health care bill , but she did not .\nshe merely said it was good that a bill was passed .\ngheesh , cnn !!!\nfinally a bush with a brain and a heart .\nwow .... probably disowned by now .\nwith thinking like this perhaps she should have dna done to see if she is really a bush .\nwell , when i found out she was working for teh global health corps i knew , if she had an open mind , she would see the inequity in healthcare .\nshe obviously has gotten around and seen the real world .\nanyone who has a brain can see how unfair our health care system is and that we needed to do something .\ni ca n't tell you how much i abhor your headlines .\ncnn is the one trying to \" raise eyebrows . \"\nlet 's stick to the news and keep editorialization where it belongs i never thought i 'd see the day when someone with jarge bush 's dna in their veins that has has a brain .\neven though jarge bush will always remain the dumbest humanoi to walk on earth , his bush daughter somehow managed to escape the evolutionary chain of destruction her father was responsible for .\nsounds like the children of gop leaders have their own mind and do n'tnecessarily follow their parents .\nfirst it was megan mccain , now barbara bush .\nbravo for them .\ni 'm sure it is hard to tow the same line as your parents did .\nalso note the sons of ronald reagan .\nthey are on differerent sides of the aisle as well .\none thing to note on the kids of bush and mccain , they are part of the newer generation who see things quite differently than their parents did .\na bush who can actually think outside of the lines drawn by party ideology .\nnow that is refreshing !\nthe bush daughters and mrs. bush just reinforce in our minds what we already knew , that they are classic rhinos and are as responsible for the mess this country is in ast like mr. obama and his liberal and leftist friends .\nthis is what the political class and establishment of both parties have brought us , debt , taxes , refusal to face reality and poliical arrogance !\nyou go , sarah !\nsave us from this cast of disreputable phonies !\nit 's nice to see that someone in that family has ( 1 ) a heart and ( 2 ) brains .\nmaybe it was the milkman or the cable guy instead of george ... very interesting given the way she was raised .\nif she is serious , i admire her for it .\nif she lives like a wealthy person then i think her statements would be curious .\nbasically , wealthier people world wide have better access to food , housing , entertainment , clothes and healthcare and even water !\nin this country , if someone works 40 hours per week , they should have access to reasonable food , housing and healthcare .\nif someone is working 40 hours per week and really ca n't afford this stuff , then we should help them .\nwhat we need to get away from is people who are lazy , retire early , fake disability or minimal disability not working and thinking that they have a right to free healthcare .\nthough i was deeply opposed to most of george w. bush 's policies are president , i respect how his family members have minds of their own .\nit shows that the former president is open to opposing views ... even in his own family .\ni have alot of respect for her for expressing that view on fox news .\ni also have a growing respect for her dad , who has shown a great deal of integrity in not criticizing our president the way that dick and liz cheney have .\nkudos to the bush family .\nshe 's too young and naive to understand why , the bill was a bad bill .\nshe will learn , later .\nthe girl gets her brains from her mother 's side of the family .\nit is time now to vote for the best family .\nthe bush family is impressing me each day which goes by .\nthis young lady understands well , that life is serious enough , not to take side and follow her fellow republicans !\nthank you barbra bush .\nany well rounded american wants health care for all americans .\nonly the ' hate our black president an never agree with anything he says or does ' that think this black man is out to get them , are the poor lost souls that want only for themselves and to hell with the other man.the younger generation will bring positive change to america , as the bigeted older whites die out , america will see the coming together of one nation under god .\ni am a white grandmother and i hope i live to see that day happen .\ni pray for our president everyday .\ni can not stand to listen to racists like fox news , sarah palin , glen beck , limbaugh , an hannity is a disgrace to man , because they do not speak for the average voter , they are the problem in this country.sadly the uneducated are being preached this hatred and dis-respect from these fringe right low-class bigots pretending to be journelists .\nbarbra bush is the beginning of this new era that will hopefully bring the change america needs .\nsmart woman .\nlooks like her apple fell from the mother 's tree .\nfinally , someone with practical common sense from the bush clan who can speak their mind .\nyes , barbara seems to be of the same intellectual and idealogical mold as her mother ; perhaps even her father and gramp , but they may be speaking for the party rather than their own beliefs .\none suspects it is the latter , and i do not see her speaking out without her father knowing about it and agreeing with her likely statements ( even if that was not clear before the faux noise interview .\nnote also that the interviewer is not exactly ayles ' favourite person on the channel ; not in the same way as insanity homes or prof. glum buck .\ni 'm glad she has the guts to say what she believes .\nwait until she pays taxes for 20 years in order to \" keep up \" democratic parasites of the lazy and worthless , she will grow up and see the light.\nwhen too lazy to work-be a democrat and have the government keep you up .\nit 's plain to see that this woman has been brainwashed .\njust

loyal to the pakistani taliban commander , hafiz gul bahadur .\nbahadur has reportedly overseen multiple attacks against nato troops in afghanistan .\nwhile the cia drone war against al qaeda in pakistan is well known and is even , on occasion , publicly acknowledged by senior obama administration officials , the strike against bahadur 's fighters is part of a lesser-known campaign to target pakistani militants , who are less able to pose a threat to the u.s. homeland .\nthis represents an expansion of the drone program that was overseen by president barack obama 's administration .\nin 2004 president george w. bush authorized for the first time the covert lethal use of drones inside pakistani territory .\nduring his tenure , there were 45 drone strikes in pakistan 's federally administered tribal areas ( fata ) , according to data compiled by the new america foundation .\npeter bergen reports on location in afghanistan .\nbut when president obama took office in january 2009 , the program ramped up quickly , accelerating from an average of one strike every 40 days to one every four days by mid-2011 .\nthe new america foundation maintains a database of every reported drone strike in pakistan 's tribal regions since 2004 .\nwe monitor reports about the strikes from reliable western and pakistani news sources , such as the new york times , the associated press , cnn , reuters , express tribune , dawn , and geo tv .\nall told , the 307 drone strikes launched by the united states in pakistan between june 2004 and june 2012 have killed an estimated 1,562 to 2,377 suspected militants , according to news accounts .\npakistan to open supply routes into afghanistan of those strikes , 70 % have struck north waziristan , home to factions of the pakistani taliban and the haqqani network , which has often launched operations in kabul against civilian targets .\nover a third of these strikes have reportedly targeted members of the taliban , with at least 10 of the strikes killing senior taliban commanders , as well as hundreds of lower-level fighters .\nthe united states ' aggressive drone campaign in pakistan slowed considerably in 2011 .\nthere were 70 drone strikes in the tribal regions that year , down from 118 in 2010 , which saw the peak number of strikes since the program began .\naccording to our data , 6 % of the fatalities resulting from drone strikes in 2011 were civilians , up 1 percentage point from the figure in 2010 .\nover the life of the program we estimate that the civilian casualty rate is 16 % .\nclearly , as the years have progressed , the drone strikes have become more precise and discriminating .\nin march 2011 , pakistani maj. gen. ghayur mehmood acknowledged this when he said \" the number of innocent people being killed is relatively low \" and that \" most of the targets are hard-core militants , \" the first such public acknowledgment by a senior pakistani military officer .\nsimilarly , president obama made his first public comments about the covert drone program , when he told participants of a google + \" hangout \" on january 30 , 2012 , that the united states only conducts \" very precise precision strikes against al qaeda and their affiliates , and we 're very careful in terms of how it 's been applied . \"\neven if it is the case that there are relatively few civilians killed in the strikes , the drone program is quite unpopular in pakistan .\nduring the summer of 2010 the new america foundation sponsored one of the few public opinion polls ever to be conducted in pakistan 's federally administered tribal areas and found that almost 90 % of the respondents opposed u.s. military operations in the region .\nthe wider pakistani public shares this sentiment : a june 2012 pew research center poll found that about three quarters of pakistanis consider the drone campaign to be unnecessary .\nopinion : obama ramps up covert war in yemen even so , the strikes may have contributed to a relative decrease in violence across pakistan .\nthere were 41 suicide attacks in pakistan in 2011 , down from 49 in 2010 and a record high of 87 in 2009 .\nthe 118 drone strikes carried out in 2010 coincided with an almost 50 % drop in suicide attacks across pakistan , according to the pak institute for peace studies , which monitors pakistani militant groups .\n( another factor in the reduction in terrorism in pakistan surely was the pakistani military 's own operations against the taliban , particularly its 2009 campaigns in swat and south waziristan .\nsome 1,600 taliban fighters were

information to the united states , suggesting they feared betrayal from within .\nlast month , a top taliban commander in south waziristan halted all polio eradication efforts in the area for fear that the health workers were , in fact , u.s. spies in disguise assisting the cia drone program .\nthe cia drone attacks in pakistan have undoubtedly hindered some of the taliban 's operations , killed hundreds of their low-level fighters , and a number of their top commanders .\nbut they have also slowed considerably since their peak in 2010 , and have come under harsher scrutiny both in pakistan and the west , rendering the program 's future in the region uncertain .\nthe cia strikes may also be fueling terrorism .\nfaisal shahzad , an american citizen of pakistan descent trained by the pakistan taliban , tried to detonate a car bomb in times square on may 1 , 2010 .\nthe plot failed , but shahzad subsequently claimed that the drone program had fueled his anger against the united states .\nhere is a list of the taliban leaders who have been killed in the cia drone campaign , according to data compiled by the new america foundation from reliable news reports : june 18 , 2004 :

'\nit would n't get their attention . \"\nhenning points to a 2009 report , published by the annals of the new york academy of sciences , rounding up evidence that radiation has had a lasting effect on the health of the population in contaminated areas .\nin belarus , for instance , cancer morbidity increased 40 % from 1990 to 2000 , the report said , and girls age 10 to 14 born to irradiated parents had an increase in malignant and benign neoplasms .\nmettler counters this with the chernobyl forum report and a report from the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation , which both had stamps of approval from representatives of the governments of russia , belarus and the ukraine .\nthe chernobyl forum report said that while increases in congenital malformations in children have been reported in belarus since 1986 , the rates are not related to radiation and \" may be the result of increased registration \" -- i.e.\nmore people reporting their family 's health problems . \"\nthe majority of the ' contaminated ' territories are now safe for settlement and economic activity , \" although certain restrictions need to remain in place on the use of land in some areas , the report said .\nmore than 5 million people in belarus , russia and ukraine living in \" contaminated \" areas received whole-body radiation from the accident , but in doses not much higher than the natural radiation in the environment , the report said .\ndoes that mean that a healthy person could safely move to an area that has been cordoned off for decades and not have an increased risk of cancer ?\ndavis is n't so sure -- but said he believes it has n't been studied extensively enough . \"\ncommon sense would dictate that it 's probably not a great idea to live in a highly contaminated area and eat produce produced in the fields that are contaminated , or be in constant exposure mode , \" davis said .\nchernobyl : environmental dead zone or eco-haven ?\nboth international reports highlighted the mental health toll as well ; the chernobyl forum report called this the greatest public health problem that the accident caused .\nmore than 330,000 people were relocated from the hardest-hit areas , which was a \" deeply traumatic experience \" for many . \"\nthere is no question that people who either are exposed to radiation or think they might have been , suddenly are very nervous , and every time something happens , they go , ' oh , my god , what is this ?\ndo i have a problem ? '\nand they dash off to the hospital , \" mettler said .\nstudies have shown that this population has a higher level of anxiety and are more likely to report that they have physical symptoms that they can not explain , according to the chernobyl forum report .\nthey 're also more likely to say they are in poor health .\nthe report noted that as the media began to speak of \" chernobyl victims \" and governments offered disaster-related benefits , \" rather than perceiving themselves as ' survivors , ' many of those people have come to think of themselves as helpless , weak and lacking control over their future . \"\ngorelik was not evacuated after chernobyl .\nshe grew up in the region of gomel , the same area where she and daniel live today .\nabout a 20-minute drive away is the \" dead zone , \" where entire villages have been abandoned since 1986 .\ngorelik and daniel stayed with henning 's family in the seattle area during part of the summer .\nthey returned to belarus at the beginning of august , henning said .\nduring their time in the pacific northwest , they saw the ocean , mountains and a rainforest , in addition to various doctors .\ndaniel put on 4.5 pounds during the six-week stay . \"\nyulia and daniel saw various doctors and it was determined that many of their health issues could be attributed to the poor nutrition that is so common in this area of belarus , \" henning said in an e-mail .\namong the nine children and two adults , including gorelik , who spent this summer in the united states through hope for chernobyl 's child , a total of 47 cavities were filled , four wisdom teeth were pulled , and 60 blood tests were taken , henning said .\nthe belarusians gained a combined total of 26.5 pounds .\ngorelik said in july that hope for chernobyl 's child has given her not only material help but also mental support .\nthe gratitude she feels toward the organization and her hosts is immeasurable , she says .\nreflecting on her situation , her words about lack of control are reminiscent of the chernobyl forum report : \" if you are living in bad conditions , sometimes , you feel like you are alone .\nyou do n't have control of your life .\nyou do n't have any support .\nyou do n't have any hope , maybe .\nthere is only one hope , to god .\nbut if you meet some people who can give you their hands , and their help , it is making you stronger , it is making you happy , really happy .\nthat 's why i 'm grateful with all my soul . \"\ngorelik and daniel left for their long journey back to belarus on august 5 , including a 13-hour layover in frankfurt .\nhenning and colleagues arranged for them , and the others in the hope for chernobyl 's child group , to rest in a lounge at the airport .\nsuch cross-cultural friendship has become part of the fallout of chernobyl .\n26 years on : helping chernobyl 's children follow elizabeth landau on twitter and google +", "summary": "establishing a relationship between disease and radiation exposure is not clear-cut , experts say ."}

the airport having been in existence even before that time .\nthe answer for the faa 's decision had to lay in what happened to malaysia airlines flight 17 .\ni think we all get it .\nso what ?\none

considered too cautious .\nthat being said , u.s. airline pilots understand the concept of mitigating risk .\nnot everything we do as humans is completely safe .\nbut israel 's el al airplanes have a little more risk mitigation in their arena .\nthe robust israeli airline has missile detection and defense systems installed .\nmost of these systems are designed to automatically thwart an attack

for safety of flights into areas of conflict what exactly is the criteria ?\nhow can yesterday be unsafe but today is all clear ?\nshould missile launch frequency and distance from the airport be calculated via an algorithm ?\nshould the type of warhead be considered ?\nif there is to be a standard , the requirement to have it disseminated for airlines and their flight crews is a must .\nthe israelis have obviously set their own standards .\ni ca n't think of an area on the globe that is more focused on security than tel aviv .\nin that regard , should the criteria to halt flights be different for ben gurion airport than it is for cairo international airport ?\nbecause of our military , u.s. airspace is full of activity involving more live ordnance than anywhere in the world

furthest concept from an airline pilot 's mind when it came to threats was a missile attack — and certainly not a missile attack at cruise altitude .\nbut if this is a new day , then airlines and

the candidates is the looming -- and likely very consequential -- showdown in new york .\non the republican side , trump hopes to quash the competition and secure as many of the 95 delegates as he can to continue his march to the nomination .\nhere are the highlights of the weekend in politics : that the nominating process is \" rigged \" to block him .\npriebus dismissed trump 's comments as \"

the rules that will govern the gop 's july convention in cleveland , and when they 'll be set .\npriebus wants to delay any rules changes for now .\nbut rnc rules chairman bruce ash , who is part of a group of conservatives who want to openly debate rules changes when they meet in a few days , on saturday accused the party 's top lawyer , john ryder , of attempting to stifle that debate and a \" breach of trust \" in an email obtained by cnn .\nryder , who is supporting priebus ' efforts , replied that it had been a misunderstanding .\nhe cautioned in a reply email that \" it is important that the rnc not take action that can be interpreted as attempting to favor one candidate or another ... major changes now are dangerous and not a good idea , in my humble opinion . \"\nat the center of the fight is a push by conservatives on the republican national committee to have robert 's rules of order govern the convention instead of the rules of the u.s. house .\nit sounds arcane , but conservative rnc members argue the change is needed to prevent party establishment figures from pushing through someone like house speaker paul ryan in the convention .\n-- who polls have shown

competitive .\nboth vermont sen. bernie sanders and the former secretary of state were duking it out in an increasingly negative contest .\nnew york 's contest is a pivotal one , because it 's sanders ' chance to show he can win in big , coastal states with heavy minority populations -- something he 's yet to do .\nthe two candidates were trading barbs over the weekend on guns .\nclinton , a former senator from new york , hit sanders hard saturday . \"\nno matter how often he is asked by family members of those who have been murdered , he sticks to his talking points , \" she said .\nsanders ,

state where he was born , and clinton 's adopted home -- casts its votes .\na week later , pennsylvania , maryland , connecticut , delaware and rhode island are up .\nwho called the amount of money he 'd raised for hillary clinton \" obscene , \" is backing the wrong candidate in the 2016 presidential race .\nasked by bash on \" state of the union \" if clooney is backing the wrong horse , sanders said , \" well , i think he is . \"\nsanders said : \" he is honest enough to say that there is something wrong when few people -- in this case , wealthy individuals , but in other instances for the secretary , it is wall street and powerful special interests -- who are able to contribute unbelievably large sums of money .\nthat is not what democracy is about .\nthat 's a movement toward oligarchy . \"\nsanders ' comments came after clooney told chuck todd on nbc 's \" meet the press \" that he was n't fond of raising huge gobs of money -- more than $ 300,000 per person to join him and clinton at the head table at a friday night event in san francisco -- for candidates . \"\ni think it 's an obscene amount of money .\ni think that , you know , we had some protesters ( friday )

right .\nit 's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics .\ni agree completely , \" clooney said .\nbut here 's the caveat , he said : the money is largely \" going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back congress .\nand the reason that 's important and the reason it 's important to me is because we need -- i 'm a democrat so if you 're a republican , you 're going to disagree , but -- we need to take the senate back .\nbecause we need to confirm the supreme court justice because that fifth vote on the supreme court can overturn citizens united and get this obscene , ridiculous amount of money out so i never have to do a fundraiser again .\nand that 's why i 'm doing it . \"\nwith one win under his belt , ohio gov.\nabout the delegate selection process .\nhe dismissed trump 's accusations that the gop nomination process is \" rigged , \" calling on the republican front-runner to \" act like you 're a professional , \" in an interview with

{"document": "president obama is meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday .\n( cnn ) -- president barack obama says he is n't bluffing when he says iran should n't have a

the ropes , do we want a distraction in which suddenly iran can portray itself as a victim ? \"\nhe said this week in an interview with the atlantic .\nobama , who will be meeting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday , said a permanent solution is necessary . \"\nthe only way historically that a country has ultimately decided not to get nuclear weapons without constant military intervention has been when they themselves take ( nuclear weapons ) off the table .\nthat 's what happened in libya , that 's what happened in south africa , \" obama said .\nobama said iran and israel understand that he is n't bluffing about his opposition to an iranian nuclear weapon . \"\ni think that the israeli government recognizes that , as president of the united states , i do n't bluff , \" he said . \"\ni also do n't , as a matter of sound policy , go around advertising exactly what our intentions are .\nbut i think both the iranian and the israeli governments recognize that when the united states says it is unacceptable for iran to have a nuclear weapon , we mean what we say . \"\nobama said he 's not going to take \" any option off the table and will pressure iran until it \" takes a different course . \"\nhe stressed the importance of political , diplomatic , and economic sanctions against iran .\nhe said the west has a \" sanctions architecture that is far more effective than anybody anticipated \" and tough sanctions \" put a world of hurt on them . \"\nhe also said that a transition to \" a peaceful and stable and representative syrian government \" from the pro-iran bashar al-assad regime would be \" a profound loss for iran . \"\n\" preventing iran from getting a nuclear weapon is n't just in the interest of israel , it is profoundly in the security interests of the united states , \" he said .\nobama emphasized the risks of iran obtaining a nuclear weapon .\nhe said it would \" run completely contrary to my policies of nonproliferation . \"\n\" the risks of an iranian nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorist organizations are profound .\nit is almost certain that other players in the region would feel it necessary to get their own nuclear weapons , \" obama said . \"\nso now you have the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world , one that is rife with unstable governments and sectarian tensions .\nand it would also provide iran the additional capability to sponsor and protect its proxies in carrying out terrorist attacks because they are less fearful of retaliation . \"\nobama noted his concern about nuclear escalation if iran builds a nuclear weapon . \"\ni wo n't name the countries , but there are probably four or five countries in the middle east who say , \" we are going to start a program and we will have nuclear weapons . \"\nand at that point , the prospect for miscalculation in a region that has that many tensions and fissures is profound .\nyou essentially then duplicate the challenges of india and pakistan fivefold or tenfold , \" he said .\nobama was asked about two differing assessments of iran .\nnetanyahu said three years ago it 's being led by a \" messianic apocalyptic cult . \"\ngen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said the leadership is \" rational . \"\nthe interviewer , jeffrey goldberg , asked where obama fell \" on this continuum . \"\n\" there is no doubt they are isolated , \" the president said . \"\nthey have a very ingrown political system .\nthey are founded and fueled on hostility towards the united states , israel and , to some degree , the west .\nand they have shown themselves willing to go outside international norms and international rules to achieve their objectives .\nall of this makes them dangerous .\nthey 've also been willing to crush opposition in their own country in brutal and bloody ways . \"\ni think it 's entirely legitimate to say that this is a regime that does not share our worldview or our values .\ni do think , and this is what general dempsey was probably referring to , that as we look at how they operate and the decisions they 've made over the past three decades , that they care about the regime 's survival .\nthey 're sensitive to the opinions of the people and they are troubled by the isolation that they 're experiencing . \"\nobama said netanyahu has a \" profound responsibility to protect \" israelis , given the holocaust and anti-semitism . \"\ni think it 's important to recognize , though , that the prime minister is also head of a modern state that is mindful of the profound costs of any military action , and in our consultations with the israeli government , i think they take those costs , and potential unintended consequences , very seriously , \" obama said .\nthere have been reports of friction between obama and netanyahu .\nthe president was asked if they are friends and talk about matters other than business . \"\nthe prime minister and i come out of different political traditions .\nthis is one of the few times in the history of u.s.-israeli relations where you have a government from the right in israel at the same time you have a center-left government in the united states , and so i think what happens then is that a lot of political interpretations of our relationship get projected onto this , \" he said .\nobama said he and netanyahu \" can be very frank with each other , very blunt with each other , very honest with each other . \"\n\" for the most part , when we have differences , they are tactical and not strategic .\nour objectives are a secure united states , a secure israel , peace , the capacity for our kids to grow up in safety and security and not have to worry about bombs going off , and being able to promote business and economic growth and commerce . \"\nobama has been criticized by some for not adequately supporting israel 's security interests , but he said , \" we 've never had closer military and intelligence cooperation . \"\n\" when you look at what i 've done with respect to security for israel , from joint training and joint exercises that outstrip anything that 's been done in the past , to helping finance and construct the iron dome program to make sure that israeli families are less vulnerable to missile strikes , to ensuring that israel maintains its qualitative military edge , to fighting back against delegitimization of israel , whether at the ( u.n. ) human rights council , or in front of the u.n. general assembly , or during the goldstone report , or after the flare-up involving the flotilla -- the truth of the matter is that the relationship has functioned very well , \" obama said . \"\nflotilla \" was a reference to israel 's raid on a gaza-bound flotilla that left nine people dead .\nthe goldstone report was a controversial assessment of israel 's gaza offensive .\nobama said \" there 's no good reason to doubt \" him . \"\nwhy is it that despite me never failing to support israel on every single problem that they 've had over the last three years , that there are still questions about that ? \"\nsome of it has to do with the fact that in this country and in our media , this gets wrapped up with politics .\nand i do n't think that 's any secret .\nand if you have a set of political actors who want to see if they can drive a wedge , not between the united states and israel , but between barack obama and a jewish-american vote that has historically been very supportive of his candidacy , then it 's good to try to fan doubts and raise questions , \" he said .\nobama cited his \" full-throated defense of israel \" before the u.n. general assembly , for example . \"\nour goals are in sync .\nand historically , one of the reasons that the u.s.-israeli relationship has survived so well and thrived is shared values , shared history , the links between our peoples .\nbut it 's also been because it has been a profoundly bipartisan commitment to the state of israel .\nand the flip side of it is that , in terms of israeli politics , there 's been a view that regardless of whether it 's a democratic or republican administration , the working assumption is : we 've got israel 's back .\nand that 's something that i constantly try to reinforce and remind people of . \"\nthe president also countered those voices who say he is n't up to using military power to stop iran . \"\nif people want to say about me that i have a profound preference for peace over war , that every time i order young men and women into a combat theater and then see the consequences on some of them , if they 're lucky enough to come back , that this weighs on me -- i make no apologies for that .\nbecause anybody who is sitting in my chair who is n't mindful of the costs of war should n't be here , because it 's serious business .\nthese are n't video games that we 're playing here . \"\nbut obama said the record shows he 's willing to take military action when necessary , citing the assassination of al qaeda leader osama bin laden and actions against the taliban .\ndrone strikes have been used regularly against militants along the afghan-pakistani border during obama 's term . \"\nso aside from the usual politics , i do n't think this is an argument that has a lot of legs , \" obama said .",

, nick traveled from his home in virginia to philadelphia to become a part of the experiment .\nthis new therapy was decidedly different from the treatments he 'd received before : instead of attacking his cancer with poisons like chemotherapy and radiation , the philadelphia doctors taught nick 's own immune cells to become more adept at killing the cancer .\ntwo months later , he emerged cancer-free .\nit 's been six months since nick , now 15 , received the personalized cell therapy , and doctors still can find no trace of leukemia in his system .\ntrusting her intuition led to two

: changing the way surgeons fight cancer in addition to the pediatric patients , penn scientists tried the therapy out in 37 adults with leukemia , and 12 went into complete remission .\neight more patients went into partial remission and saw some improvements in their disease .\nthe treatment does make patients have flulike symptoms for a short period of time -- nick got so sick he ended up in the intensive care unit for a day -- but patients are spared some of the more severe and long-lasting side effects of extensive chemotherapy .\npenn will now work with other medical centers to test the therapy in more patients , and they plan to try the therapy out in other types of blood cancers and later in solid tumors .\na university press release says it has a licensing relationship with the pharmaceutical company novartis and \" received significant financial benefit \" from the trial , and porter and other inventors of the technology \" have benefited financially and/or may benefit financially in the future . \"\nsearching for one-in-a-million cancer cells the big question is whether nick 's leukemia will come back .\ndoctors are cautiously optimistic .\nthe studies have only been going on since 2010 , but so far relapse rates have been relatively low : of the 18 other pediatric patients who went into complete remission , only five have relapsed and of the 12 adults who went into complete remission , only one relapsed .\nsome of the adult patients have been cancer-free and without a relapse for more than three years and counting .\nrelapses after this personalized cell therapy may be more promising than relapses after chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant , porter explained .\nfirst , doctors have been delighted to find the reengineered t-cells -- the ones that know how to hunt down and attack cancer -- are still alive in the patients ' bodies after more than three years .\nstigma lingers for deadliest cancer \" the genetically modified t-cells have survived , \" porter said . \"\nthey 're still present and functional and have the ability to protect against recurrence . \"\nsecond , before declaring patients in remission , penn doctors scoured

100,000 to one in a million cancer cells , and did n't find any in nick or any of the patients who went into complete remission .\none of the best aspects of this new treatment is that it wo n't be

university .\nhe is the author of \" jimmy carter \" ( times books ) and author of the forthcoming book \" governing america \" ( princeton university press ) .\n( cnn ) -- at a time when many of us are making promises to change our behavior in the new year , politicians in washington should make some resolutions of their own .\nin the past year , public disgust with the politics has intensified .\nthe approval ratings of congress are in the tank .\nthe ratings of the president are much better but still low .\namericans do n't trust politicians , they do n't trust government , and they have no confidence in the system .\nin their eyes , the nation 's capital reflects the worst of the nation , not the best .\nwhat are some resolutions to which both parties could commit ?\nthe first would be to do something about the power of money in politics .\nwithout campaign finance reform , the system wo n't change .\nin the past two months , there have been two grassroots movements , one on the left and one on the right , that have rallied supporters around trenchant criticism of politicians for not listening to voters but instead paying heed to the interest groups who finance their campaigns .\nthe occupy wall street movement talked about the power of financial elites while the tea party looked more at liberal interest groups such as organized labor .\ndemocrats and republicans paid lip service to these complaints .\neach promised to be more responsive to this frustration .\nbut realistically , unless the parties embrace some kind of campaign reform , these problems wo n't go away .\nthe reason that politicians are under the influence of the lobbyists on k street , rather than the interests of main street , is clear .\npoliticians need money to run their campaigns .\nthe situation has grown worse in the past year since the supreme court undercut existing regulations on corporate donations .\npresidential candidates have abandoned the watergate-era public finance system for campaigns .\nindependent organizations , such as karl rove 's operation , american crossroads , have developed sophisticated mechanisms for raising and distributing huge amounts of cash for advertising on behalf of candidates -- or against them .\none of the biggest forces in this campaign thus far have been the super pacs , which are pouring out millions on political advertisements and taking advantage of loopholes in the federal election laws to protect the identity of their donors .\nthe second resolution must be for the parties to do a better job in the campaigns .\nthis is an election year when the nation faces huge and difficult issues .\nthe inability of private markets or the government to stimulate muscular economic growth and significantly reduce unemployment has left millions of americans desperate .\nfor some , the rising deficit is a huge challenge that must be handled immediately , with the twin causes being the massive tax cuts enacted under president george w. bush and the growing fiscal cost of medicare and social security .\noverseas , the changes that have swept the middle east have opened up huge questions about u.s. policy in the region .\nunfortunately , the presidential campaign , officially starting this week with the iowa caucuses , will likely be a race to the bottom .\nthe candidates will probably focus on character and personality without talking about policy other than in the shallowest of terms .\ncandidates will try to pin on each other the label of flip-flopper or dwell on the personal lives of their opponents , rather than pressing each other to address the huge problems that we face .\nthe parties would serve the nation by truly engaging the opposition over the choices we face in coming years .\nthe final resolution should be for an agreement to limit the use of obstructionist tactics .\nover the past year , the republican party has dramatically escalated the procedural battles to new levels .\nin addition to the ongoing filibuster threat that grinds the senate to a halt , forcing it to find a supermajority of 60 votes to pass a bill , and a refusal to act on many presidential appointments , we have seen the budget process turn into a national joke with routine decisions becoming subject to threat , delay and constant temporary solutions .\nthe process seems unworkable .\ndiminishing the use of procedural obstructionism does not mean some kind of nostalgia for a bygone bipartisanship .\nmembers of both parties can stick to the party line while restoring some kind of balance to the legislative process so that members can actually vote their will .\nthe political system in this country is delicate .\nwhile the framework has endured , it is possible to tie the legislative process into such knots that it ca n't do its job .\nto be sure , there is little chance that politicians will adhere to these promises .\nlike most people who join the gyms or promise to act better , the chances of following through are minimal .\nit is likely that washington will only become a tougher place in years to come .\nbut perhaps , even for a moment , the leaders of both parties should think about what they do to america when they weaken the political system upon which we all depend .\nthe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of julian zelizer .",

guantanamo .\nhe 's decided we can hold people in guantanamo indefinately even when they 've been cleared of all charges against them .\nhe 's signed an assassination order against an american citizen .\nhe has refused to allow american war crimes to be prosecuted .\nsure , i have confidence in obama ; confidence that he will continue to hammer nails into the coffin of the us constitution .\ndisappointed would be a good word for how i feel about obama but i remain certain that he 's a damn sight better than the alternative we were offered in the election and waaaaaay better than anything the teabaggers will try to offer in 2012 .\ni had no confidence when he was erected into the monarchy and he has done nothing but validate my opinion .\nthere are those who would forgive him for any transgressions but the rest of us will have to live with destruction he is legislating .\nwithin those \" only 17 months \" , we have a president that has had to deal with two wars , an unprecedented economic collapse , and the worst environmental disaster in u.s. history while working with a highly polarized senate to get anything done .\ni think he 's done alot given those circumstances , and i will remain confident in him for now .\nmr obama does just fine .\nhe inherited a mess that still unfolds .\nthis can not be stopped rightaway .\nhe handles things in cool but this perception era does not allow for that .\nthe people need an emotional man somehow .\nit 's the president 's brain that counts .\nhe has the right team at hand and sooner or later things will turn around .\nand even than , it needs time to sink in with 300 mln .\nplus people .\nit 's also the media blowing things out of proportion .\namericans do n't know just how lucky they are with this president .\nno one is even giving him a chance to succeed .\nevery thing he says and does is second guessed – no human being can succeed when you stack everything against one person .\nwe need to lend him our support so not just him but the country can succeed .\nno faith whatsoever ... he is worthless and should never have been elected .\nhe is attempting to destroy this country from within for his muslim religion look at historic opinion polls of just about any president , including st. ronald ... after the election , the bloom starts to fall of the rose as the candidate becomes the president .\nthis one had a pretty full plate when taking over , and an already very angry population ... for me much too early to say whether i 've \" lost faith \" or not .\nthese are human beings dealing with huge issues , very tough to make people happy .\ni am glad we have a sober , mature , thoughtful person in there though .\nthere is hope people , especially if you are a republican may not acknwoledge it but this president has done a wonderful job leading this country so far .\nunfortunately for him , the mess and economic chaos left by the previous administration created a lot of obstacles to what president obama set out to achieve for a better us .\none after another these hurdles are coming in the way of his achieving anything , be it job growth , economic recovery , winning the war in afghanistan .\ni think he is determined to tackle all these and get the americans out of the dire situation .\nhe is a good leader and things will get better jack .\nwatch my word .\ni can honestly say from voting the past 30 or 40 years that mr. obama has no less of my confidence than presidents during those years .\nas far as i am concerned they obey the laws of the mba 's and market themselves to success , the company or country be damned .\ni would like to hear him say \" how do you like me so far \" ?\nnone , we need a leader , unfortunately we have a community organizer like most other people , my confidence in the president has plummeted over the past year .\nit is a dreadful time to be president because of the financial mess he inherited , and the gridlock in washington , but obama wasted a year on a health care reform bill which appears to be horribly flawed .\nthis president obviously thinks there is a rational solution to every problem , but the specifics of his \" solutions \" always seem insipid when compared to the rhetoric prior to any decision .\nj.r. 's saying in the old tv program \" dallas \" that a person is \" all hat and no cattle \" unfortunately comes to mind now when obama 's name pops up .\nthe president seems to be all speech and no deliverance .\ni would hate to be him over the next two and a half years .\nhe has started slow and now is tapering off .\ni have full confidence in him .\neveryone expected way too much from him .\ndue to his decisions things have and will continue to get better .\nhe started in a very deep hole .\nthis man is not only not trustworthy he is a threat to the american way of life .\nlook at his appointments of marxists sympathizers .\nlook at his takeover of the banks and auto industry .\nlook at how he does n't accept responsibilty but demonizes those who do not agree with him .\nhe fails to fulfill his constitutional obligation to uphold our laws , specifically securing our borders .\nlook at his broken campaign promises .\nno he is not worth of trust and confidence .\nzero confidence.\nthe only confidence i have is that the republicans will take back the white house .\ni have zero confidence for obama .\nwe do n't need a socialist party , we need to get back on track .\ndo n't know where you get you stats ... but word on the streets is president obama 's is doing his job and we have great confidence in his leadership .\ni have more confidence in president obama than i did under the last 8 years of the previous administration .\nnone , he is a troubled president and needs to be stopped .\nthe government has proved time and time again that they lie to the people and they are in bed with big corp , , and do not respect the legal citizens of america and turn on other states in america , , no amnisty for federal law breakers and no government is going to fix anything if big corp tells them not to – mr. cafferty ; i listened to president obama 's press conference with the president of russia and many more .\nlisten yanks , you have one of the smartest leader in the world , please ... do n't blow it ... again how much confidence do i have in obama ?\nthat is an easy one .... none .\ni am sure that there are plenty of people who will always support the president , however , i am one that has never and will never support him .\nhe is acting like a 3 year old , ' play by my rules or i will have a tantram ' yes , i have a lot of confidence in president obama .\ni think he is doing an excellent job with the amount of stuff on his plate .\ni do n't think the media helps though by only showing negative stories or portraying articles and headlines in a negative or misleading light .\nmy confidence in president obama has not changed.i am proud at how he has managed to remain as strong as he has after one misfortune after another .\ni ca n't remember a president hit with so much in so little time .\ngive him a chance , he is not god , nor some kind of prophet , but his servant , as we all are.i do n't think any president has faced such great expectations or criticism and disrespect as this one .\nobama has a fantastic political ability – he can make people think he has told them what they want to hear while actually saying nothing of substance .\nit makes for a great politician but a singularly terrible president .\nzero .... that is none , no confidence .\nnow if we can only get a \" no confidence vote \" we can impeach him and get a president with whom we can have confidence confidence in president obama ?\nzilch , nil , zero , nada , none .\nhe 's destroying america single handedly .\ni have more confidence in him than ever , since yesterday 's events .\ngiven the alternatives , and the huge issues before him : a near economic collapse , 2 wars , natural disasters and a congress that does n't work , i do n't think anyone could handle this better !\ngiven the alternatives – bush before obama , and mccain and palin instead of obama – give me a break !\ni have lots of confidence in president obama .\nof the big three characteristics needed for a good leader – charisma , integrity , and intelligence – he seems to have at least two and arguably three .\ni believe he understands the complexities and subtleties of the country and the world as well as anyone , and i also believe he sincerely wants us all to succeed .\ni have more confidence in him than most of the people that scrutinize his every move ... it 's a complicated job and complicated world !\nlet him do his job and get on with yours !\nhe is an empty suit .\nthe worst is yet to come .\nobama is doing a great job .\nno other leader in history has ever been able to bring about prosperity by spending money he does n't have .\nwe are truly witnessing a trillion-dollar miracle .\ncan you imagine where we would be if john mccain was president ?\nhe all talk the only thing have done talk no action i disgree with him about the gulf diastar .\nabsolutely no confidence in him .\ni simply have not seen leadership exhibited period .\nno ideas .\nbad , old policies .\na complete disappointment .\nhe just seems like he is theorizing or playing a chess game .\nhe 's either unaware that what he implements impacts millions of lives or simply does n't care .\ni can not tell which .\nabout as much as anyone would have in the president in these circumstances , be he dem .\nor rep. or whatever .\nwhen the days are good ; we have in-fighting and bickering ; when the days are bad ; whoever is unfortunate enough to be in office bites the popularity bullet .\ni certainly have more confidence in him than health insurance ceos , bp , wall street , the banks , or any of the other people who ran for president for either party in 2008 .\nsure , that 's not saying much , but do you know anyone else in power in the us that would be anymore trustworthy ?\nhey the guy can make a decision without dick cheney so he 's ok in my book .\nfrom ottawa canada , listen people have to understand obama is just a man , he can not change the whole world unless the whole world is ready to be changed !\nthat being said living in canada i can tell you that a lot of the citizen here have no trust at all in stephen harpers and he 's nevertheless the one taking all the important decisions so those polls has no signification whatsoever !\ni think you americans need to give him more time to make things happen and to get the job done !\nshould i remind you that most of the problems he is facing right now was there before him ????\ni lost my confidence in pres.\nobama .\nhe is well spoken , but when it comes to action he delivers un-presidential results .\nthis is not what i voted for .\ni 'll take president obama any day , any time over what we had before .\nthis is exactley why we need health care .\namnesia is taking over as the # 1 health problem .\ni do n't think he is a very good president and i have no confidence in him .\njack , i did not have a lot of confidence in barack obama to begin with .\ni knew most americans would be patient in the beginning of his presidency .\nwell fast forward 17 months and nothing has really changed .\ni was not so optimistic because i know that the president can only do so much to improve the economy .\npresident obama has done his part and now we just have to wait it out .\nthe ironic thing is all his supporters thought he was the messiah and could change everything for the better .\nthey were wrong .\nand now he is to blame .\nthe vicious cycle continues .\ni have a lot of confidence in the president .\nwhat it seems like a lot of people want is an immediate fix and someone to hold their hand through every one of their problems .\nfrom what i have seen , the president is doing exactly what i expected from him when i voted for him and if you expected something different then you were n't paying attention to what he stood for .\n100 % 100 % more than i have in any member of congress .\n50 % more than i have in any news media .\ni have a lot of confidence in president obama .\nfrom virginia g. in utah i have all the confidence in the world in obama !\nit 's so funny how fickle people are , he 's elected to fix all the screw ups left by the last administration and finally when things are getting better for the economy , important consumer protections are passed including health care , everyone wants to forget about what the last administration has done and want so revert back to it !\namerica wake up !!!!\nit did not take us 18 months to get into the situation that we are in , for god 's sake get a reality check !\nthis man is doing the best that he can do with all that is going on in the world at the present .\nhe is our president and we need to support as much as possible .\nhe has my prays on a daily basis .\ni have zero confidence in him .\namerica is finally realizing that mr. obama is a brat in a suit and is unqualified for handling any crisis .\nhe quickly found out that he could not give a speech and make the oil disappear .\nshame on america for electing him .\ni can see no reason to have any confidence in obama .\nall he has shown me is a willingness to \" lecture \" at the drop of a hat .\nhe won election as a novelty , but the novelty has worn off .\nno confidence .\nhis adminstration gave a waiver to bp days before the oil spill .\nhe is pushing amnesty while unemployment is almost 10 % .\nwe now find out he knew about blago selling the seat and actually sent rahm up with a list .\nsomeone , save us .\ni 'd vote for him again .\nas a people , we want quick solutions to major problems without having to give up anything to get there .\ni 'm convinced no one would have done any better under similar circumstances .\ni am a white female senior citizen who has full confidence in our president .\ninclude me out of those numbers that you were just talking about .\nplease .\ni have confidence in president obama .\nhe would be doing just fine if he did n't have to spend 25 hours a day fighting the people that are doing all they can at every turn to cause him to fail .\njack , this is a man that has to fight republicans just to be able to go to the rest room in peace .\nnone !!!\nand i voted for the man .\ni am now constantly apologizing to others for my misguided vote .\ni am a moderate conservative and have never been a \" party guy \" for either party .\nthat said , i will be pulling the lever for everyone with an \" r \" after their name in the next election .\ni have always said that was wrong in the past , but this guy and all his cronies need to be ousted at all costs .\ni have very little confidence in the current president , he got elected on a social movement rather than political prowess , experience , knowledge or any inkling of leadership .\nhe has blundered left and right , he waffles , and almost every decision he makes seems to have some sort of offering bundled into it for the extreme left in this country .\nhe ca n't make a tough decision withoutconsidering what impact it will have on his dwindling base .\nhe never had the right , he 's losing the middle and he 's pissing off the left by leaving his extraordinary promises to them on the campaign unfulfilled .\ni think he will definitely be a one term president .\nhope ... fully .\ni am a white 52 yr old middle class man residing in upstate ny and i have the utmost confidence in president obama.\ni have never felt more connected to a sitting president in my life .\nhe is smart , articulate , and personable , and i like his style !\nthe problem with people in our conutry is we live in the \" now \" and do n't give people a chance .\nour president inherited a mess and it is obvious he has been working diligently to tackle our nation 's problems .\ni am extremely impressed with his foreign relations abilities as well as his efforts to improve our economy .\ni think he is doing all he can do with the gulf oil disaster under the circumstances .\nplease people , give him time ... are you kidding jack ?\ni could n't even listen to busch talk !\ni found myself squinting all the time .\ni do n't know if it was from the pain of his ignorance or the perlexing configurations of his words .\nnothing made sense .\nnow we have a president who is smarter than most that went before him and people just ca n't handle his intelligence .\nthey would rather see ann coulter or r limbaugh in office spewing hatred than someone there who has done more for us in his short tenure than busch did in 8 years .\ncome on !\nconfindence ?\nabsolutley .\nhow much confidence in obama ?\nabsolutely none !\nzero , zilch !\nnada !\nonce again , he showed that kindergarteners handle such situations better than he did .\nthey 'd start chanting , \" sticks and stones will hurt my bones , but names will never hurt me . \"\nobama ?\nhe fires the 4 star general because it hurt his overinflated , titan ego .\nnever mind that it extends the war with a second-string gen. in there .\nhow was general mccrystals \" misjudgment \" different than obama 's charging ahead with that heathcare bill we did n't want , or vp biden leaving an open mike ... etc.\n, etc .\nobama in my opinion , is the greatest president we have ever had .\nhell can freeze over before i jump ship to the republicans.\nthe president is scapegoat to it all .\nmr. obama is sleek in his mannerisms and will ride out the storms !\ni continue to believe our president is incredible .\ni like his cool style because when people are in the midst of anger , their thinking is a bit blocked and people say things they do n't really mean .... it 's not good to have to eat your words .\nour economy has begun to level off , health care reform was passed ( after decades of trying ) .\nour relationships with the rest of world seem to have gotten better ... the wars go on with dates to begin withdrawal .\ncould you do all that in 18 months ?\nno one is perfect , but i think our president is darn close !\nthe president gets it coming and going .\nit does n't matter what he does , there will always be those who are unhappy and choose to whine and carry on .\nthese negative whinners are the ones who usually get the media 's attention unfortunately .\npresident obama inherited a lot of problems .\ni think he 's doing a great job !\nif elections were held tomorrow , i 'd vote for him again .\ni believe his intentions are honorable , but he does n't have the leadership qualities that these difficult times require .\nit 's not just experience .\nnobody comes into that office prepared for it .\nbut this man is so emotionally detached that he seems to take refuge from the pain out here by striding into yet another meeting in the white house , and forming yet another commission to report back to him in another month , instead of being out front and taking charge where all the hurting people can see him and take courage from him .\ni campaigned for him , i voted for him , and i wish now it had been hillary .\nmea culpa .\njack , i remain most confident in our president .\nluck , good or bad has nothing to do with my vote of confidence .\nin so many of these issues he is judged on , he has absolutely no power over .\nand , in the ones he has power over i agree with his decisions .\ni like your daily question feature jack , but what would you be filling the airtime with if you and others could n't second guess our quarterback ?\nwhat other president in recent history had so much dumped on his plate and has absolutely no backing at all from most of the republicans .\ni feel he has done an outstanding job under the circumstance 's .\nhe has my full support .\nr. weber i feel confidant pres.\nobama will continue to do a good , not perfect , job .\nhe has a steep learning curve , but there are infinite possible problems and any decision will have its downside .\nthe public \" s expectation of what a president ( especially about the economy ) can control is so ridiculously high that no mortal can please us .\npres obama has inherited or been subject to the most diverse challenges in recent history in the midst of a severe political landscape .\nhe has shown statesmanship above and beyond the cries of polling and will be held in esteem for his leadership and deep concern for all the people of america .\ni feel perfectly comfortable and in safe hands with his oversight and guidance .\ni have confidence that the president is incompetent .\nfrom his lack of military knowledge to his denial of help in the gulf from those who have offered .\nwe are less safe and less secure with president obama in charge .\nan actually experienced manager would have closed his office door ripped mccrystal a new one ; told him to keep his mind and his mouth focused on the job – then sent him back to do it .\nbeing washington , word would have leaked out in a millisecond and the military and the congress would have known who was really in charge .\nnow ...... its amateur hour again .\ni have a lot of confidence in president obama .\nif you think back on all of the issues he has had to deal with in his first year and a half ( financial crisis , two wars , iran , and now this spill ) , and how overwhelming they all have been , if you really think about it , how there have been more huge crisis than any president has ever had to deal with all at once , and how we somehow have not totally fallen apart and have somehow remained a stable nation , i think that under the circumstances , that this is extremely remarkable and truly amazing and a testament to his steadfast character .\ndespite criticism for having a cool head , i think that it it were not for president obama 's ability to remain cool and in control of himself under so much pressure , that we would not have been able to weather so many storms .\ni still have confidence in the president .\ni mean , let 's face it ... he inherited a real poop storm just 17 months ago and warned that it would n't be easy to turn things around .\ninstant gratification was not a part of any of the campaign promises !\nthe public has a short memory .\nwith the economy continuing to slowly improve , and pieces of health care reform moving into place his numbers will get better just in time for 2012 .\ni am really tired of hearing that pres.\nobama is not managing the problems well .\nhe was given all these problems , anyone who blames the economy on him is dead wrong .\nhe needs to go after wall street the way he handled british petroleum .\nas for the war well he inherited that problem from the bush administration .\ngeorge w. bush left a planet sized problem in the war on terror , i think theresa put it best , \" we the people are a bunch of wimpy , cowardly whinners who say we want change but lack the courage to make any sacrifice in order to secure our future as a prosperous nation .\nwe have abandoned our president who is fighting for us .\nwe do n't really want health care reform or energy independance or to save the environment .\nwe just want lower prices and lower taxes and we want it now , no matter what it costs our children and future generations to come .\nwe the people are a nation of children who desire a leader who is like a comic book super hero \" i have lost my confidence in him .\ni think he really does n't know what he is doing .\nhe seems confused and i dont see any sense of leadership in him .\nis like he is worried about winning the next election which will probably not happen if he continues like this .\nwhoa , jack .\nyou might better ask people who they do have confidence in .\nbig business , maybe .\nhow about wallstreet ?\nwho exactly do we think can do a better job with the massive problems facing us ?\nfolks are just disappointed that obama was not able to magically solve all their problems .\nwe all had a part in digging this hole and it is going to take a change in attitude for us to climb back out of it .\nan empty suit .\nan unrelenting arrogance .\na complete failure .\nhe refuses to take responsibilty for the failures of his administration . \"\nblame bush \" has become shrill and sophomoric .\nhe knew exactly what he was getting into , and promised swift changes .\nthere 's been no change .\nand i 've lost hope ... i have a lot of confidence in president obama .\nmore than i ever had with the last president .\nhe is only one person , people ca n't expect pres.\nobama to perform miracles in a day because people are unsatisfied and want every issue fixed in a hurry .\nall the negative comments about him is a bunch of crap .\ni say to the pres.\n, shake it of your shoulders and continue doing what you 're doing .\npeople will always have something dumb to say .\nput yourself in his shoes before you talk the talk .\nhe has not condemned the attempt to build a mosque on the site of the twin towers massacre in nyc .\nwhat more do you need to disapprove of his leadership ??\npres.\nobama has done nothing to keep the confidence of his 2008 supporters , nor has he done anything to gain the confidence of mccain supporters .\nhe is full of rhetoric and very little substance .\nhis go-to solution for everything is more government .\nour economy is headed in the wrong direction and he does n't seem to know what to do to fix it .\nhe cares more about his public opinion and poll numbers , and is not willing to make the tough decision .yes , he has had to face tough situations ( sluggish economy , bp oil spill , etc. )\n, but he ran to be the president of the united states .\nit is a tough job , and he knew that when he started working towards the white house 6 or 8 years ago .\nwhen something goes wrong , he says he is responsible , but then finds a way to point the finger at someone else .\ntruthfully , we should have known this in 2008 .\nthe guy is very smart ( no doubt ) , but has very little experience and was not qualified to be elected .\nhe has proven to be lacking in crisis management .\nin short , i have very little confidence in pres.\nobama .\nthe only question – will the gop field a credible candidate to replace him in 2012 ?\ni have absolutely no confidence in this , the worst president in history .\nhe has fumbled every opportunity to bring the country together and move us forward .\nhe is politician that will say anything but has no results to show for actions .\nwhat is worse is that some final few are staying in support of obama despite his failure to complete one single campaign promise .\nremember the \" change \" and hope \" theme .\nremember he was going to close gitmo and end wars , and so more empty promises .\ni pity the fools that feel for this looser .\nthe best they can ever come up with is \" at least he is not bush .\nidiots !\ni continue to have confidence in president obama and his ability to make decisions and his ability to empower the people under him .\nas for the happening in the gulf , while i would never wish this type of disaster on anyone , it may turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to improve the lack of beauty of the brackish waters that i have always found to be some of the ugliest coastal region in the world .\nseveral years ago , upon visiting , i found the water oily then , and the coastline was very industrial looking .\ni am a white , southern woman and i also support obama in his decision to request the resignation of general mccrystal .\ninsubordination , under no circumstances should be tolerated .\ni can bet if you ask these some of these people to list the accomplishments of obama in the 17 months he has been the president , they would n't have a clue .\namericans are looking for a quick fix .\nthere are no quick fixes .\nthis country was left in a bigger mess than anytime in history .\npresident obama has atleast saved us .\nit frightens me to think where the country would be now had mccain and palin won .\ni do feel somewhat better .\namericans continue to complain but are not getting on their party to work with the president to correct the problems in this country .\nbush and cheney left this country in such bad shape that no president will ever be able to fix it for years .\ni do n't blame president obama for anything but trying his best to fix this mess .\npeople in this country are such big complainers .\nwhat they need to do is try and get their representatives to work for the people in this country instead of putting all the money in their pockets .\npresident obama is not the one who is cheating the american people .\nthis is such an unfair question i have high confidence in president obama 's leadership .\nhe is like the civil engineer who has to make a decision about what to do with a bridge that has major problems ( 2-wars , gulf spill , run away general , etc. )\nhis job is to direct the events that maintain the integerity of the bridge ( country ) .\ni does not help when people that were asked to reduce strain on the bridge ( country ) by not placing additional weight ( counter manding directives designed to preserve the bridge – hence the drilling moritorium on drilling .\nit takes more than the engineer to keep bridge viable .\ntell people that what president kennedy said \" ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your courntry \" .\nwe together can make things better for all if we work together .\nproverb \" a wise woman buildeth her house but a fool pluckethed down with his hands \" i support president obama 100 % .\nhe inherited tremendous mess and is working across party lines , trying to do what is best for this country .\nhe had committee members from both parties come up with solutions .\nhe is honest and genuinely cares about people .\nit seems he 's damned if he does allow oil drilling and damned if he does n't allow drilling .\nwe should have gone into afghanistan , not iraq , and we would n't be involved in two wars .\nhe helped the auto companies get out of a mess .\ni believe people are generally good , but our politians , regardless of their party , only care about being re-elected , rather than making tough decisions that are best for our country .\nour image has improved around the world since bush and that alone is a big accomplishment .\ni will reiterate that i support our president .\nno one could do any better with the mess he acquired .\ni i have complete confidence in president obama !\nhe has done more for america the past 17 months than bush and his administration did in the 8 previous years .\nwe wanted change-and change we are getting .\ngive him the time he needs !!!\nhe is still the man to get us through all the stuff going on .\nhistory will show this .\ntill then , he needs some better luck .\ni have full confidence in the president .\ncertainly more confidence in him than the president he replaced .\nconsidering where we were before election day and where we are now , things can only continue getting better .\nif not for the distraction of the biggest oil accident in history and the lies and deception that came from bp , we would be even further ahead in the progress department on the slow road to economic recovery .\nnote the the stock market has rebounded considerably since 2008 .\nlet us not forget the complete mess he inherited .\ni had not confident in president obama , the president do not have leadership , experience and i feel that his policies are destroying the foundation of our precious country .\ni do have confidence in president obama .\ni think the limbaugh philosophy of \" i hope he fails \" has been adopted by the republican party .\nthey are apparently doing whatever it takes to make sure this administration fails to correct the previous administration 's errors .\nat the same time they are subjecting the american people to further frustration and anger .\nlet 's direct the anger where it belongs – the no party .\nnone .\nhe blames all his problems on someone else .\nhe thinks it should be his way or no way .\ni say we impeach him !!\nhas everyone forgot about 9/11 and the administration that was in control then and the mess they left behind ?\ni do n't have any less confindence in obama than i have had in any other president during my years of voting .\ni think congress is more to blame for the problems we are facing and our economy crisis than our current president .\nabsolutely !\nconsidering the mess that he stepped into , he is working the united states out of it , slowly but surely .\nhow easiely we forget that we ( the americans ) have been pushed into the hole , that the last 8 years of administration slowly dug .\nwhat has he done as president to earn anyone 's confidence ?\nhe talks good , but what has he actually accomplished to inspire confidence ?\ni predict he will not even run for reelection .\nhe does not want to govern .\nhe wants to be on television .\nhe belongs in hollywood , not washington .\nyou forgot to mention the war against one of our very own states , arizona .\nalso , the grand redistribution of wealth schemes with obama 's government take-overs of private industry , and the untruths that are now surfacing from with the health insurance fiasco .\nadd all this with what politico pointed out and we have a ( dangerous ) loser in the white house .\nconfidence ?\nnot at all .\nrespect ?\nnot at all .\nhe doesnt have confidence or respect for the real america .\nhe is a joke and all the people that voted for him are ... well ... .\nyou know ... .\nstupid !!!\nabsolutely none !\nhe has proven over and over again to be totally incompetent and working hard to destroy our country .\nimmigration required waiting your turn , laws to limit the stay , etc .\nbabies should not be the ticket to our hard earned dollars supporting illegal aliens .\ni am proud to be an american and all that we stood for , not the new shameful happenings .\nwe are \" one nation under god \" and our currency and basis \" in god we trust \" .\nif you do n't , give me my dollar back and get out .\nthis man needs to get out while the getting is good .\ni am happy people are beginning to see the president 's poor leadership skills .\nhe has been a terrible decision maker , always wants to form a group to study all situations !!!\nnot much and luck have nothing to do with it .\nevery president have their challenges , some more some less .\npresidency do not inherent problem , problems continues down the presidency .\nhe needs to face the challenge and no more excuses .\nas the president of united states he is the captain of the ship , there is no one above him to cry to .\nobama came into office with hope and change as his mantra .\nnow the rest of us are hoping he will change .\nyou have to be careful for two things in life jack the first is what you wish for and the other is what you vote for .\ngive the pres a break im tired of hearing conservatives cry about the pres responce to this and that what happened to small government ?\nthey want the fed to do everything .\nand to all the people in the gulf complaining about their buisness get over it and get off their butts down there and find a new job the gulf is gon na be messed up for decades take your welfare from bp and move on with your lives none .\nthe man is a walking disaster .\nlet 's get back to voting for a president based on his experience and knowledge and not for his oratorial skills .\ni have more confidence in obama than i had in bush , carter , ford , nixon and lbj and possibly reagan and clinton as well .\nwhich of these former presidents faced as many crises simultaneously than he has ?\nnot to mention dealing with the blogosphere and the world of tweet and instant criticism .\nall in all , he 's holding up pretty well .\ncut him some slack , jack !\nwalker if youmust know how much confidence i have in president obama , i will tell you , i have complete confidence in our president .\ni will say about 100 % confidence i place in mr. obama .\nyou ask why ?\nbecause no one in this country will give president obama the credit he deserves .\nhe 's been our president for about a 1year now , and he gets more criticism than complements .\nit 's a disgusting human nature to give criticism more easily than to complement someone even when he deserves it .\ni do n't think we could have gotten a more kinder , gentler , smarter , president than we have right now .\nand do n't think for one minute mr. obama is a push-over .\nwhen push comes to shuve , mr. obama will use the necessary force to get things done .\ni have total confidence in president obama .\nhe will make some mistakes as all of us will but overall he is the man we need for this job .\nby the way , if the news media would be more supportive of the positive things he is doing rather than blaming him for everything that occurs , the rank and file person who limits his/her knowledge to what is said on the * news * would be more correctly informed .\ni have all the confidence in the world with president obama , after all we sent him in there to clean up the disaster of the republicans .\nyou may have forgot , but i have n't , and seeing them apologize to poor , poor bp makes me even more confident .\ni for one and apparently a minority continue to put my faith in the man at the helm .\nhe kept our economy from falling off a cliff , many companies are now profitable , and he has a strong international team that deals well with serious international issues .\nwhile the opposition continues to complain incessantly , especially through the so called tea party , they offer no realistic alternatives .\ni like pres.\nobama because he is a genuinely intelligent man who ably articulates his position and acts to carry it out .\ni have n't seen anything close to him on the other side of the aisle .\nyou may want to leave the following out : i consider the leading spokesperson of the opposition , i.e.\n, the lady from alaska , nothing more than an empty suit .\nlarry burke , va what a fickle bunch we are !\ni was not a staunch supporter before the election , as were some , but give the guy a break !\nhas anyone ever had to handle a more historic load of major crises in such short succession ?\ntwo wars , a world financial melt down , an epic environmental crisis , none of which were of his making – what do we all expect ?\nthat is probably the problem .\ntoo many expected miracles from him and he is only a man after all – a brilliant , thoughtful one to be sure , but give him a chance .\nthese problems are all so complex that it is ridiculous to expect instant results .\nlet 's stop sniping and being cry-babies and see what we each can do to help .\ni am sick of all the whining .\nlet 's be americans and come together to fix things .\nhe sure ca n't do it alone .\nhave all these people who have lost confidence in president obama forgotten about our previous president so quickly ?!?!\ni have the utmost confidence in president obama – unfortunately , bush left us with an economy in the tank and a huge deficit – now suddenly the republicans want to act like the party of balanced budgets ???\ni am grateful that obama is in the white house with all the problems ( b.p.\nspill , mcchrystal , etc. )\nwe have had lately – none of which were caused by him .\ntime to move to another subject , jack - jack , i never miss your comments if i am able .\npresident obama has lost the confidence of most of us seniors ( i am 82 & my wife is 79 ) due to such actions as robbing from the poor and giving it to the rich ( stopped our 2010 cola but did not stop everything we buy from going up 20 to 30 % ) .\npromised us help with the terrible cost of our drugs ( they are breaking us financially ) but now i hear that it will be next year before any help arrives .\nwhat a farce .\njim i am tired of seeing people talk about what obama inherited .\nthey should be interested in what obama has not done in the 17 months he has been in office .\npeople need to get over george bush .\nobama is in the driver 's seat and he 's acting like a drunken driver .\ni am very impressed with president obama as a leader and do highly respect him as a person .\nhis approach and responses to the many challenges he has faced shows a respectful dignity towards others plus the leadership skills needed to command our country .\nfor many , he will never be able to do anything right but those are the masses that enjoy hearing their own condescending comments that flavor their negative attitudes .\nhow much confidence can you have in a guy who ca n't understand the founding father 's principles and the constitution ?\ni have tremendous confidence in the president .\nthe country has enormous problems due in large part to the policies of the last administration , and president obama and his team appear ( to me ) to be trying address the issues in a thoughtful way ... not shooting from the hip , but attempting to address the complex structural weaknesses .\nthese are n't issues that have quick fixes , and it distresses me greatly that , 24/7 , the media pundits pick away at him for their own on-air or column-filling purposes .\nwhen you think that you hear waning confidence in this man , perhaps you 're reflecting the sound of your own echoing voices .\nas a republican when he was elected i was willing to give him a chance .\ni know he inherited many problems .\nhe promised to bring people together and to change the way washington operated .\nhowever , he has failed to do either .\nwhy people thought he was a stromg leader is a puzzle to me .\nhe had never been in charge of anything !\nat this point i have very little confidence in him .\ni have total confidence in our president .\nhe is facing problems greater than most any of us have ever seen or lived through .... .\nand i am 78 !\nhe is amazingly intelligent , is willing to listen , think , and compromise whenever possible .\nplease look at what happened during president bush 's term and what that administration left for this administration to deal with .\nour president deserves a dozen stars !!!!\ni/we continue to support president obama .\ndo not agree with everything he does but 100 % on shutting down drilling in the gulf .\nwe survived the exxon/valdez spill and further drilling will only jeopardize lots of jobs .\nfor what ?\nso stockholders can continue their lifestyle ??\nwe support drilling on dry land and , with limits , offshore .\nwe also survived sarah palin 's short governership ( voted for her ... mistake ) and will move to canada if she takes over .\ngive me a reasonable person any day .\nobama ... 100 % .\nmr obama is in over his head .\nthat lack of experience thing , is haunting him .\nhe is a smart guy , and hopefully , he will grow into the job .\nif not we are screwed .\nwe are looking at a one term pres.\n, with no minority pres.\nagain for a generation .\ncomplete confidence .\nwith issues he inherited , we need magic to solve them all in such a short time .\nhow can someone solve all problems by himself ?\nno matther what president obama does , it 's never good enough .\nsomeone from the side line is unhappy with it .\nand it 's very easy to be on the side line and just talk .\nhe is a man of action and i 'm proud of him !\ndo americans look at things with the glass half full or the glass half empty ?\npositivity will bring out the positive .\nthat 's all i have to say about the american people .\nlet 's stop looking for the bad-anyone can do that .\nlet 's support the president like we should .\nlet 's think of the good we have in america instead of looking for dooms day .\nthe more we support him the stronger this country will get .\npointing fingers will not get us any closer to the american we want .\nwe are as strong as our weakest link – and that ourselves .\ni have very little confidence and i am disgusted with a president and congress that keeps making decisions for purely political reasons that ignore the wishes of the majority .\nforeign policy has little real direction , the economy is not getting better , the current administration seems to oppose any attempt to close our borders , and medical insurance costs are rising .\nnot much to admire !\n.\ni have little confidence in his ability to lead , he has shown that over the last 17 months .\nhe has made some good decisions , but a lot more bad ones .\nhow he handled the oil spill is the worse so far .\ni am only confident that he will kill the free market .\ni am not blind , it started with tarp while president bush was in office , but president obama has stepped on the accelerator .\nit has been said that , in the end , people get the government/president they deserve .\ni heartily disagree .\nfrom what i 've seen in my country lately – we have a long way to go before we deserve him as he is far , far beyond what we deserve – so much more and with so much dignity , integrity and intelligence that is balanced with the practical .\nhe inherited a hornet 's nest of trouble that can not be explained or solved in a 30-second sound byte .\nso , bottom line , i think he is doing just fine – also great that he can continue to function as well as he can with all the ridiculousness that abounds !!!!\nthe man was all smoke and mirrors during the election .\nthose with \" hope \" that he could turn his party rhetoric into real leadership are now disappointed .\nthe scary part is that we 're all in the same boat that he 's sinking in .\npeople need to become informed citizens so they can see what is going on .\nit 's heavily coded in the media to lull people to sleep .\nwake up america .\ni have very little to no confidence in pres.\nobama .\nhe was clearly not ready to handle the many problems that any chief executive must confront daily .\nwe had an inkling of what his performance would be like since he was not often a participant in either the illinois legislature or the united states congress .\nhe can give a great speech but unfortunately that just doesnt cut it when serious decisions have to be made .\nhe needs to surround himself with more people like sheila baird and sec ' tates , the two people in his administration who have the best interest of the country at heart .\nnever did , never will , only getting worse .\ncant ' wait till he is out of office i have n't lost faith at all in our president , barack obama .\ni have confidence that he will do his best at recovering our economy , bettering our schools and finding a solution to end our wars overseas .\nits takes time and some people put blame where blame isnt due , explain to me how you would fulfill a job where bush ?\n/ chaney administration left us nearly lifeless as a country , you would need more than 17 months , maybe a century .\nour econemy is bad , military stretched to the limits , employment bad , homeless and hungry people with no one to turn to , crisis after crisis ........ yes it was bad before president obama but it has gotten much worse .\nit 's like every one in the government is running around like chickens with their heads cut off .\nafter being inspired by the lofty rhetoric of the campaign , i have become utterly dismayed by his inability to lead the nation and to deliver the real change we we need so desperately in washington .\nlooks like president obama will join jimmy carter as one of the most ineffective ( and one-term ) presidents in the last one-hundred years .\ni have complete confidence that obama 's presidency will be nothing but problems and that he 'll blame them all on someone else , mostly bush .\ni have all the confidence in the world , he is the best we have had for a long time .\nhe was handed a country deep in debt , on the verge of bankruptcy , all manufacturing jobs had gradually been shipped overseas for the last ten years , the country is recovering gradually which is a miracle , the last great depression took 10 years to recover .\nhe was handed 2 wars a minority obstructionist party and has suffered racist slurs for the 17 months since he was elected , i think he has worked miracles considering what he was given.\nall the naysayers should be careful what they wish for , if the repubs get the majority the rest of the county 's wealth will be handed to the rich , not to mention the death toll for people with no healthcare will rise.\nthe rest of the civilized world shakes it 's head in disbelief that we are such a crappy country we can not give our people health care .\nhe is an ideologue that came in with an agenda .\nhaving said that , i believe most presidents and indeed most of us as constituents are similar ....... in that we look at things from a certain point of view .\nwhat bothers me , though , is that his ideology is in direct conflict with all of our founding fathers and the document that is meant to run this country .\ntheir vision for this country was that it would be different and unlike the place they came from – it would be a bastion of liberty , personal responsibility and individual freedom .\nif mr obama has a problem with those things ..... and i believe he definitely does ..... than why not go try to run a country where those things are not valued and written into the core of our society .\ngo to europe or south america or somewhere ..... but not here where our heritage is founded on the very principles he seeks to tear down .\ni have reasonable expectations and confidence !\nanyone who has confidence in this man , is obviously not paying attention .\nhe is a clown and has shown that he is completely inept .\nhe has surrounded himself with the morally destitute and continues to thumb his nose at the will of the majority of the populous .\nour miliary mocks him , and the world is marvelling in his weakness and indecision .\npathetic ... simply pathetic .\n2012 ca n't come soon enough .\nconfidence ?\nnone that i can say that 's on the plus side .\nthis president is/has been inept at almost every turn .\nhe 's not capable of making a decision unless it 's one that will cost us trillion $ , or from recommendations from an equally inept staff , commission , or congress .\nthe only smart thing he has done is the firing of the general .\nin that case his hand was forced by the general himself .\na decision that was a no brainer .\nhe has dragged his feet , seemingly by design , on the oil spill .\nmakes you wonder .\ndoes it not ?\nhe is \" not \" reponsible for the blowout .\nbut his adiministrations ' ineptitude and foot dragging have greatly added to the disaster .\nonce he exhibits the ability to make a decision without weeks , or months , of political calculation perhaps he may gain some the confidence to which you refer .\nuntil then .\nnone .\njack .\nlets get real for a minute .\nobama has had to deal with the budget mess left by the previous administration ; two ( 2 ) unpopular wars ; the banking crisis ; the housing/morgatge crisis ; the auto manufacturers crisis ; a republican minority that is more interested in saying \" no \" than working with the president of the united states than solving america 's problems , and a host of other problems .\nvery few presidents in the historyof the united states have had to deal with this many serious problems than he 's had to , and he 's only been if office for two years .\nhow many years did it take to create this mess ?\nit 's easy to be an \" arm chair quarterback \" and critique the game while it 's being played or after it 's over , especially in today 's political climate !\nwe should all give the president our support to fix these problems instead of trying to assess blame !\nboy jack you americans are a fickle bunch .\nyou elect a man with more integrity than the last 5 presidents combined and turn on him because a greedy oil company is fouling the gulf with the same garbage he 's trying to break your addiction to , oil !\n90 % of the problems president obama now faces were created by the idiotic decisions of george w. i do n't expect obama 's bad numbers will last to long .\ni do n't have confidence in any politicians , but at least obama is sincere and is trying to do the best with what he 's given .\ni might vote for him for a second term , but that will depend who 's running against him .\nif it 's sarah palin , he 'll be a shoo-in for term 2 in my book ... anyone but the alaska barbie !\ni am confident he will continue to push his socialist agenda .\nhis disdain for the american way of life is evident in every move he makes .\nif he is reelected , he will destroy us .\nconfidence ?\nno ... hillary clinton was my choice , this corrupt regime began when the party system made its choice instead of allowing the people to choose .\ni voted for mr. obama and truly hoped he would be a good president even though he obviously did not have the experience .\ni am particularly concerned about his disregard of the seriousness of the illegal immigrant problem and jobs creation .\ni do n't think he likes us .... .\npresident obama is doing the best any one man can do under the circumstances .\ni still have faith because he does .\nzero : he wasting money on bail outs and health care programs the majority of the public did not want and do not approve of .\nhis radical environmental policies are going to hurting the economic recovery and cause most americans to pay large increases in fuel cost and lose more jobs .\nthese policies will provide no reasonable improvements in environment when compared to the cost .\nwe know we have problems when his top military leaders are publicly laughing at him and his staff .\nhis solution to illegal immigrants to grant them amnesty .\ngovt does n't create jobs .... they create debt .\nobama would do a better job at presidency if he just sat in a rocking chair and staired out the window .\nhas to be the worst pres.\never ...... .\ni predicted before the election that he would win , and then lose confidence with the american public .\nhe has much to overcome with all the baggage that he inherited .\nthe voters are quick to forget what president obama had served to him on inauguration day .\neveryone thinks in this day and age that the problems can be solved overnight .\neverything he has accomplished so far , he said he would do ............ .\nnow everybody complains .\ndo they forget how hopeful the country was with all of his new ideas ?\nat least he 's willing to listen to everyone 's viewpoint , unlike the \" my way or the highway \" republicans .\nyes ........ .\ni 'd vote for him again , and i 'm very proud to say i did so .\ni have 200 % confident plus more .\ni repeat what i said in my earlier comment .\ni support president obama and his efforts to lead this country .\ni do n't have confidence in polls , because polsters design pollls to get the results they want .\nconfidence in obama ?\ni have more confidence in him than i have in the alternative .\ni have far , far less confidence than i used to .\nwe have not gotten to where we are as a nation and a mixed society based on presidents improving in terms of consensus ( will of the people , ) with time .\nso , on that premise mr. obama is typical , average , party driven and a marginal leader as usual .\nof this i am confident .\nhistory sifts through all the b.s.\n, and years later when all the dust has settled .\ni will say , \" i told you so \" to all the bozos who voted this smooth teleprompter reader in office .\nobama is doing exactly what he said he 'd do .\nhe is fundamentally transforming america .\nif those who voted for him are shocked by what is now happening ..... then they did n't do their research .\nplease pick up a book from saul alinksky and a book for karl marx .\nit wo n't take long to understand what is happening .\nthis was a no win situation from the

sex she was , and her mother was kept sedated .\nlaurent was eventually labeled a boy , and her parents were dismissed from the hospital , unable to seek additional child care , lest their secret get out .\nwhen she was 1 ½ years old , another doctor decided to change her sex assignment so she could be raised as a girl . \"\nthey performed a clitorectomy and they told my parents to move to another town and not tell anyone where they went and never tell me what happened , \" laurent says . \"\nall those things were so traumatizing , frightening and pain-producing for my parents that it made it hard for them to relate normally to me . \"\n\" they told my parents to move to another town ... and never tell me what happened , \" bo laurent says .\nalienated from her parents , withdrawn from her peers and deeply disconnected from her medically numbed and scarred body , laurent avoided romantic and intimate connection with partners well into her 20s .\nthen , she started to seek answers .\nthe discovery of her intersex status finally offered a path into the world .\nover the course of the past two decades , with her work as an activist , speaker and founder of the now-defunct intersex society of north america , laurent has led others on a journey to connect body and soul -- their own and others ' . \"\none of the things i 'm proud of is that i think that i 've helped to provide frameworks to talk about it , narratives that are now available to other people , \" laurent says .\njim ambrose is one of the people laurent helped .\nthough he 'd been surgically assigned as female as a baby , furthered by hormones and by additional surgeries his late teens , ambrose , now 37 , vividly recalls how different he felt from the other girls , even at an early age . \"\ni remember the first girl in my class wearing a bra and i reacted exactly as every other boy in the class did , \" he says . \"\ni was enamored and fascinated . \"\nunconsciously , he knew that the interest did n't spring from girl-to-girl solidarity or a glimpse at his future .\nwatching a school-mandated sex-ed film about menstruation , he thought , \" i do n't think this is ever going to happen to me . \"\nit did n't , of course .\nambrose 's mother disclosed the reason when he was 12 and estrogen treatments soon followed .\nneither did he experience the sexual connections his peers were making . \"\ni need unequivocal visibility from my sexual partner , \" jim ambrose says .\nat 16 , ambrose -- still perceived as female by his peers -- had a girlfriend ( \" by default , \" he jokes , rather than a drive to romantically bond ) .\nhe studiously kept her away from his intimate parts .\nin retrospect , it was out of self-protection .\nwhile the girlfriend never argued , she did confess to mutual friends that the distance \" weirded her out . \"\nword got back to ambrose , and he was suddenly painfully aware that while he felt a deep detachment from his female-assigned body , it was no longer just of interest to his parents and doctors .\nit was now of interest to his peers -- and his future sexual partners .\nafter all , that 's what it had been surgically constructed for . \"\nthe guiding principle was pair-bonding with a man and to be even more specific , to make sure that i possessed a proper vessel for an erect penis , \" ambrose says . \"\nthe end goal was n't that i would be a sexually satisfied woman , or a person who was curious about other forms of sexuality .\n... my personal sexual pleasure was n't taken into account . \"\nstanford 's karkazis sees this all too frequently in her work and friendships with members of the intersex community . \"\nimagine for a moment that you want to connect with someone sexually , and you feel nothing sexual in your genitalia .\nor you feel pain .\ni know people who have tried everything under the sun and have even contemplated more surgery .\nimagine this kind of searching , \" karkazis says . \"\nthe door is closed before it 's even opened .\nyou can think you 're so damaged that no one will be satisfied with you . \"\nbut after ambrose struck up a friendship with laurent , he used her framework of disclosure to amplify attempts at connection .\na sympathetic and proactive doctor agreed with him that the removal of breasts and vaginoplasty were medically necessary -- and the way to correct a wrong that had been done to him by the medical community .\nshe started him on a regimen of compounded testosterone cream to correct bone density deficits that occurred when he stopped taking estrogen .\nwhile he had n't consciously considered transitioning to a more male-presenting body before then , his physical response to the hormones was undeniable . \"\nalmost immediately , i felt a difference , \" ambrose recalls . \"\nit 's like when a hunter is walking slowly through the woods and he steps on a branch and it cracks and the deer pops its head up to see what 's going on .\nwhat ?\nwhat was that ?\nmy body was telling me , ' hey , this shit is good .\nlet 's do this .\nwe 're into this . '\n\" a year later , when he was in his late 20s , he began taking testosterone injections and presenting as male in public .\nhis psyche and body were more aligned than they had ever been before , and he had been dating women all along , but the transition ushered in a whole new set of insecurities .\nambrose says , \" i was a man who did n't have the penis that everyone was going to expect .\nand by ' everybody ' i mean that i was really focused on dating straight women .\ni wanted to date women who were going to desire me as a man .\n... i wanted a woman to see me from across the room and say ' yeah , i want to f *** that guy , ' before they knew anything about me . \"\nhe adopted laurent 's technique of presenting his story honestly and early , telling prospective partners , \" i work at this bookstore , but mostly i do advocacy work and it sends me around the country and i organize and do workshops and i sit on committees and i do fundraising for this little organization and ... why do i do that ?\nwell , because it happened to me . \"\nand it worked .\na lot .\ndate after date after date was \" a rousing success , \" according to ambrose . \"\nit puts me in a position of somebody who is being proactive about their life .\none who is acting in defense of myself and others , \" he says . \"\nto couch it that way informs the listener -- often a potential sexualpartner -- that i care what you think , but i know enough about myself to know that if you want to perceive me as a victim , cry for me , be disgusted by me or get up and leave , you can do all of those things . \"\nmy happiness , self-awareness and ability to get up in the morning does n't hinge on whether you want me to go home with you tonight . \"\nwhile ambrose 's most recent long-term relationship ended a few months ago , he grows increasingly comfortable in the body he now has , and steadfast in his attempts at romantic connection with the right woman . \"\ni think there is a resilience gene .\nthere are so many times when i could have packed it in , or subsisted on scraps .\nor i could have chosen girlfriends who were bad for me or cruel or abusive , but i did n't , \" ambrose says . \"\ni need for them to see me as plainly and clearly as they possibly can .\ni need unequivocal visibility from my sexual partner . \"\npidgeon pagonis sought intimacy and found pain in its place .\n( pagonis identifies as neither male nor female and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \" they , \" \" them \" and \" their \" to describe themselves . )\n\" i 'm really persuaded by things , like the idea of what high school should be .\ni really wanted a high school experience and part of that was dating a boy and having sex with that boy , \" says pagonis , now 28 .\nat age 11 , pagonis was told that the genital surgery they had received as a child was to treat cancer , and the one they were about to receive was to fix a urine drip issue .\nin fact , the latter was to insert a vaginoplasty .\nat 16 , pagonis was dismayed by difficulty and pain during attempts at intercourse with a boyfriend . \"\ni 'd never had any dilation ( which would have kept the passage open ) , so it was just a shock to my body .\ni left that moment being like ' that really hurt ! '\n\" pagonis says . \"\nbut cosmo ( magazine ) said it would get better .\nit did n't get better in terms of pleasure , but it got better in terms of not hurting as much every single time . \"\n\" i let the shame of having a different body and not looking ' normal , ' debilitate me , \" pidgeon pagonis says still , pagonis soon came to associate almost any intimacy , including kissing , with the impending pain of penetration , and found any desire evaporate the moment they were touched .\nalcohol and marijuana offered some distance from the ache , but ushered in a host of other issues , including a cycle of abusive partners and vulnerability to sexual assaults while blackout drunk . \"\ni wanted to be so drunk that sex felt ok .\ni thought i 'd feel less reserved and that sex would feel good .\nyou strive to be normal when you know you 're not normal .\ninstead of talking it through , i would just drink , \" pagonis says .\nafter a college professor lectured on the topic of intersex traits and dsd to a \" psychology of women \" class , something clicked .\npagonis walked across the street from their classroom at depaul university , down into the hospital basement where , coincidentally , their own medical records were kept .\nthere , pagonis ripped open the shroud of shame and secrecy that had swaddled their body since the first surgery .\nthe terms were unfamiliar -- \" male pseudohermaphrodite \" and \" 46 xy \" -- but suddenly , so much made sense .\ntheir mother confirmed and , after throwing their phone at the wall , pagonis vowed to tell no one .\nbut souls are loud and determined things .\nthey seek and reach for connection despite all our best attempts at muffling them .\nsix months after the revelation , pagonis started dating a woman to whom they disclosed the diagnosis .\nwhile the alignment of anatomy threw their physical differences into sharp relief -- \" i still do n't think my high school boyfriend knows i did n't have a clitoris , \" pagonis likes to joke -- alternatives to penetrative sex opened up a whole new realm of connection . \"\nthese elements of intimacy are what i needed at the time , \" pagonis says . \"\ntickling is my hurrah ! \"\nfor now , the muting of sexual pleasure from the result of surgery and sexual trauma has proved a barrier to romantic pairing .\npagonis is flying solo , and attempting to find peace and pleasure in their own body with the help of a therapist . \"\n' sex is 90 % fiction and 10 % friction ! '\n\" pagonis quotes the therapist . \"\nthat stuck with me because when i was with people , i was always having fiction in my head and i thought this is because i 'm messed up and i ca n't just get off from the person . \"\npagonis relies on wise words from laurent , too . \"\nshe told me , ' who cares ?\nthink about whatever you need to .\nit 's in your head and you 're not hurting anybody .\nif you can get off , then good for you .

said .\nafter a night 's sleep , obama told donilon at 8:20 a.m. the next day to draft the order for the raid .\nby sunday evening -- which was early monday morning in pakistan -- the 38-minute mission was over , the 25-strong u.s. team having flown out of the country along with bin laden 's dead body .\nlike other obama administration officials , donilon applauded the decision and its end result of knocking out the no.\n1 man on the fbi 's \" most wanted terorist \" list .\nhe called it \" the single biggest achievement we 've ever had \" in the fight against al qaeda .\nespecially as they continue poring through voluminous material taken from the complex , u.s. authorities are more convinced than ever that bin laden had a significant operational and strategic role , not to mention a key symbolic one , in the terrorist network .\nhis death , said donilon , is a major blow to al qaeda . \"\nat the end of last year , we assessed that al qaeda had been diminished ... to its weakest since 2001 , \" said the security adviser , who previously served in the administrations of presidents jimmy carter and bill clinton . \"\nand they took a very big step back sunday . \"\none reason

currently poring through those documents , computer hard drives and other materials -- intermittently releasing information including five videotapes featuring bin laden that came out saturday .

the size of a small college library . \"\ndespite doubts from some conspiracy theorists , al qaeda itself has admitted that bin laden was killed .\nthat means that his deputy , egyptian doctor and radical ayman al-zawahiri , will rise to the top of the fbi list , according to donilon , even as u.s. and allied forces continue their efforts to find him and other al qaeda leaders .\nlast week , cia director leon panetta ( who obama has nominated to succeed robert gates as defense secretary ) told house members during a closed-door briefing that pakistan was \" either involved or incompetent , \" according to two sources in attendance .\nthere have been no indications pakistani authorities knew about or acted upon knowledge that bin laden was living in the same town as one of its top

millionaires . \"\neven after china opened up and golf re-emerged in the mid-1980s , largely as a way to attract foreign investment , the sport was saddled with serious image problems .\nit 's not hard to see why .\nthe construction and maintenance of golf courses is particularly resource intensive .\nchina is home to 20 % of the world 's population , yet just 7 % of its fresh water and 9 % of its arable land , one-fifth of which is polluted .\ngolf also remains prohibitively expensive in china ( this was one thing about which mao was right ) and it has earned a reputation as a self-indulgent , elitist pursuit .\nin a nation of 700 million peasant farmers , only a small sliver of the population can afford to play the game .\nthat small sliver should not include anyone living off the salary of a public official , but it often has over the years .\nat best , the public would view these backswinging bureaucrats as out of touch .\nat worst , they are thought to be totally

decade -- not even close .\nbeijing would say new construction is banned , while at the same time local governments would line their pockets with the proceeds from the boom .\nthere did n't seem to be

in china , and rumors that the chinese government was about to legitimize and regulate the industry .\njust wait and see how many golf courses get built then , people would say .\nthis past year , however , things changed dramatically .\nthis current crackdown actually seems to be one of the rare times that industry rumors ended up becoming reality .\nlast fall , everyone was abuzz with unofficial word of up to 100 courses being shut down in the coming year .\nconstruction had already almost come to a complete halt , and scrutiny seemed to be shifting to existing courses .\nmajor money : golf 's biggest winners this crackdown is indeed real and serious -- over dinner recently in hong kong , i was shown photos of fairways with thousands of newly planted trees on them -- and it appears to be far-reaching .\ncourses on the tropical island of hainan , where golf seemingly had the green light , have been impacted , as have well-connected developers who most assumed would be untouchable .\nthe focus of the crackdown appears to be not just a golf course 's mere existence , but its impact on land and water supplies .\nthese are valid concerns , especially in china , but who knows if the closures will really address those serious issues or just provide fodder for headlines .\nit will be interesting to see how many of the 66 courses on the government 's list close , and

{"document": "( cnn ) -- elephants are being killed in africa at an alarming rate by increasingly efficient and well-armed poachers as international demand soars for the ivory from their tusks , wildlife conservation groups say .\nthe slaughter , described by some activists as unprecedented , is enabled by ineffective law enforcement , official corruption , porous borders and a rapidly expanding population seeking sustenance , the groups say .\nand it is being driven by a growing appetite for ivory products in increasingly affluent asian countries , particularly china and thailand . \"\nchina has taken over japan as the world 's largest ivory consumer .\nand from 2006 to last year , the ivory price in china has tripled .\nso that 's why some chinese buy ivory products in africa with dollars and smuggle them back to china to sell for a better price , \" said grace gabriel , asia regional director for the international fund for animal welfare .\nbut chinese foreign ministry spokesman hong lei said his government has taken a firm stance on ivory trafficking . \"\nwe have enacted corresponding laws and regulations , and made significant efforts in enforcing them , \" he said . \"\nwe have made positive contributions to tackling ivory trafficking activities worldwide .\nwe will keep this momentum going in our future work . \"\nafrican elephant slaughter highest in more than two decades gabriel said the chinese government has done a \" great job \" in banning online trade of ivory products , ordering online shopping sites to remove such items and closing ivory trade websites .\nbut she said that while 136 chinese retailers are authorized to sell ivory products , many more illegal stores have set up shop , according to international fund for animal welfare investigations .\nthe numbers available are stark : the poaching of elephants is the most intense it has been in a decade , and the number of documented ivory seizures has reached its highest level since 1989 , a group of agencies that monitor elephant populations and the ivory trade said in june .\nthe elephant population in central africa , where the worst of the killing is believed to be taking place , has dropped significantly over the past 10 years , according to estimates cited by bas huijbregts , head of field programs for the conservation organization wwf in the congo basin region .\nthe level of butchery is a throwback to the 1980s , when an estimated 100,000 elephants were being killed every year , according to wwf .\nthe convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora in 1989 outlawed the international ivory trade and sharply reduced illegal killing in some countries .\nthe chief reason for the deteriorating situation today is the rising demand in asia and the weak law enforcement against poachers and illegal ivory traders in central african countries like the democratic republic of congo and the central african republic , huijbregts said .\nlittle is being done to prosecute the people in those countries who run the ivory trade , he said , largely because they are often local government officials who use their authority to sidestep inspections and intimidate law enforcement agents .\ncathay pacific bans shipping of shark products \" they do n't hunt themselves , but they use their government status , and indeed their government vehicles , to organize the crime behind the scenes , \" said huijbregts , who has spent 16 years working in the region .\nwildlife wardens in rural areas can have little incentive to risk their publicly funded jobs by pursuing and prosecuting powerful local officials , he said .\nthe money to be made from killing elephants for a living is also tempting for many people in the region , where population growth is rapid and poverty rates are high . \"\nwith the price of ivory skyrocketing over the past few years , it becomes a very lucrative business for local people , \" huijbregts said .\nthe wildlife wardens are often outgunned by the poachers , whose growing use of automatic firearms and other weapons has been documented by conservation groups .\nthey are also now confronting not just local poachers , but also seasoned fighters from war-torn areas of the continent like sudan , conservationists say .\nonce the ivory has been harvested from the slaughtered elephants , it is transported across thinly and badly policed borders to ports in countries like kenya and nigeria .\nfrom the trading hubs , it is shipped abroad , mainly to asia . \"\nmost illegal shipments of african elephant ivory end up in either china or thailand , \" according to traffic , an organization that monitors the wildlife trade .\nthe biggest demand is from china , huijbregts said , where ivory household items , like chopsticks , are increasingly sought after by tens of millions of people newly enriched by the country 's past decade of meteoric economic growth .\nivory is also purchased as a collector 's item or for investment , gabriel said .\nthailand is also a good market for the criminal gangs that traffic the ivory because it is a popular tourist destination with weak laws governing the sale of ivory products and lax policing , according to huijbregts .\ndespite the bleak situation , efforts are under way to clamp down on the illegal trade , as the increase in elephant killing damages governments ' credibility and , in the case of incursions by foreign poachers , presents possible security threats .\nsome african countries are starting to share information about poaching between them , huijbregts said .\nand interpol has joined efforts to investigate those involved in the trade of ivory and other illicit wildlife products .\nthe u.s. government has also

on twitter : @cevalloslaw .\nthe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .\n( cnn ) -- passengers on a united airlines flight from brussels were quarantined at new jersey 's newark airport and later released this weekend over ebola fears that turned out to be unwarranted .\nin this case and that of the ebola patient in dallas , government and our citizens struggle to define the parameters of the sanctioned suppression of individual liberty that is the quarantine .\nin the modern united states , the people boast unparalleled personal freedoms .\nwhether enumerated in the constitution or \" penumbral , \" the inalienable liberties of the individual are designed to never be overridden by the interests of the majority .\nunless , of course , you are really , really sick .\nin that case , all those liberty and property rights we talk about ?\nyeah , not so much .\ngovernment policies of quarantine and isolation raise the classic balancing test of the rights of the individual versus the security of the people .\nnearly every law or regulation can be boiled down to this analysis in one form or another .\nthe game changer here is that with an epidemic , the potential harm to the masses is tremendous , so large that it justifies virtually any invasion of individual rights .\nindeed , when one man threatens mankind itself , individual liberties go out the window , and then that window is hermetically sealed .\nand as long as you are not that \" one man , \" you are fine with that .\nquarantine is perhaps the ultimate invasion of privacy by the state , but constitutionally , it 's an authorized intrusion .\nunder the police power granted it by the tenth amendment , states can quarantine and isolate a person , property , a geographic area , and even common carriers -- which are trains , buses and airlines .\nsome definitions : the difference between quarantine and isolation is that isolation applies to persons who are known to be ill with the contagious disease .\nquarantine applies to people exposed to a contagious disease but who may not actually be sick .\nthe united airlines passengers were only quarantined .\nthe state of texas , on the other hand , has exercised its authority to swiftly isolate thomas eric duncan , the liberian citizen who is ill with ebola .\nof course , texas would prefer you use their euphemistic moniker \" control measures \" .\nsee how much less invasive that sounds than \" quarantine \" or \" isolation \" ?\nsometimes government words can sooth government action .\nof course , the authority to quarantine is not unlimited .\nstate quarantine statutes are subject to some constitutional constraints .\nthe fifth and fourteenth amendments require some \" due process \" before depriving citizens of constitutionally protected liberty interests .\nin texas , that just means an order .\nnot an order obtained from a judicial or democratic process , but a form filled out by the appropriate health official and served on the persons to be isolated or quarantined .\nfrom there , the state 's power to enforce these control measures is practically limitless and includes criminal penalties .\nthere are collateral effects to quarantine and isolation .\nwhen people are confined to their homes , they are deprived of property rights and the right to earn an income .\ncurrently only a few states have enacted laws providing any job security to quarantined employees .\nand texas has no requirement that quarantined persons be reimbursed for the consequences of being isolated .\ntexas and other courts permit an individual to challenge his or her isolation or quarantine by a petition for a \" writ of habeas corpus , \" asking a court to declare that the quarantine law is unconstitutional or violates due process .\ncourts will defer to the state 's police power and public health decisions unless they are \" arbitrary , oppressive and unreasonable . \"\nthat does n't mean it 's without precedent : if the state can not show good enough reason , some courts have struck down a quarantine .\nwhile the process may not overall feel very protective of individual rights , contagious diseases force a sobering realization . \"\ndue process \" is ultimately a fluid concept , defined by the circumstances .\nin this case , we balance duncan 's liberty interests against the governmental interest served by the restraints , and ask whether the measures are reasonably calculated to achieve the government 's aims .\nwith the nation whipped up into a fear over ebola-calypse , most people will support the government 's authority to impose these control measures , even when it appears undefined or limitless .\nbut the constitution is not the only check on the broad state authority to impose control measures .\nstate power is ultimately limited by the people ; control measures must have public support and cooperation .\nisolating a single liberian is one thing .\non the other hand , quarantining a population any larger than a cul-de-sac or a passenger jet is going to require a modicum of public support .\nif not , then , no amount of statutory or regulatory authority can prevent a popular revolt , short of the national guard , assuming they have n't taken ill too .\nthe truth is , we do n't ask about the limits of the quarantine power because we really do n't want to have to find out .\nhow far can texas \" control measures \" go ?\nmore appropriately , how far will we , as citizens , allow them to go ?\nit raises an interesting legal and moral question , one any fan of the zombie genre has wondered about : if one of our citizens is living but fatally infected , and will harm others if allowed to live out their doomed life , does the state 's broad authority include authority to terminate the infected ?\nat what point would we be comfortable with that ?\nin the zombie movies , it 's a no-brainer : generally , as soon as the group knows someone 's infected , execution follows .\nand it 's not always humane .\ndo n't think we 're above that in the real world .\nif the life of one threatens millions , does the state 's police power authorize the pre-emptive taking of that one life ?\nconstitution aside , the view of quarantine that we all really hold is one we wo n't admit to : in the case of ebola , we endorse any suppression of the rights of the individual ... until that individual is \" me \" .\nthen , we may all become champions of individual rights .\nread cnnopinion 's new flipboard magazine

was quickly fitted for a uniform , given number 42 and hustled onto the field .\nthe cubs were already taking batting practice .\nunderstandably , he was nervous , thrilled , almost bewildered , and when the manager , whitey lockman , said , \" get loose .\nyou 're starting at first and hitting seventh , \" castle had trouble gripping his brand-new bat .\nin his first round of major league batting practice , he swung at the first two pitches and missed .\nin the dugout before the game , castle huddled with don kessinger , the cubs ' veteran shortstop and another arkansas boy .\nkessinger was outgoing and laid-back .\nhe managed to keep the kid loose .\nhis only advice was , \" go up there swinging . \"\nthe cubs ' centerfielder was rick monday , another veteran , who had been born in batesville , ark.\n, just down the white river from joe 's hometown .\nbetween kessinger and monday , joe managed to survive the worst case of pregame jitters a player could imagine .\nit was thursday , july 12 , a day baseball would remember for a long time .\nthe phillies ' pitcher was a lefty , benny humphries , a wild fastballer who walked as many as he struck out .\nas joe strolled to the plate in the second inning , he gritted his teeth and told himself to swing at the first pitch , wherever it happened to be .\nhumphries thought the rookie should get introduced to major league heat and unloaded everything he had .\njoe , from the right side , guessed fastball , made perfect contact and hit a shot that landed 20 rows back in left centerfield .\nhe sprinted around the bases , much too excited for any kind of victory trot , and was in the dugout being congratulated before he caught his breath .\nhe was not the first major leaguer to homer on the first pitch he saw .\nforty-six had now homered in their first at bat , and 11 had done it on the first pitch .\nnonetheless , his name was in the record book .\nit was now open , and joe castle was n't finished with it .\nin the fifth inning humphries started off with a fastball high and tight , a brushback meant as a warning , but joe did n't get the message .\nhe worked the count to 3 and 1 , then yanked a fastball down the leftfield line , where it scraped the inside of the foul pole .\nthe third base umpire was quick to twirl his right index finger , signaling a home run .\njoe , who was rounding first and following the ball , kicked into a sprint and slowed slightly as he neared home plate .\nnow a record belonged only to him and one other .\nin 1951 , bob nieman of the st. louis browns also homered in his first two major league at bats .\nthe mets were playing the braves in atlanta that night , and the game was not on television .\ni was listening to lindsey nelson , the mets ' wonderful radio play-by-play announcer , who informed us of what had just happened in philadelphia . \"\nhe tied a record , folks , \" nelson said . \"\nthink of the thousands of young men who 've played this game , and only two have homered in their first two at bats . \"\nthe cubs chased humphries in the sixth , and the phillies brought in a middle reliever , a righthander named tip gallagher .\nwhen joe left the on-deck circle in the top of the seventh , the score was tied 4-4 , and the phillies fans , always vocal , were silent .\nthere was no applause , just curiosity .\nto their surprise , joe dug in from the left side .\nsince there was no scouting report , the phillies did not know he was a switch-hitter .\nno one had bothered to notice him during batting practice .\nhe looked at a curveball low , then fouled off the next two fastballs .\nwith two strikes , he shortened his stance and choked up three inches on the bat .\nthe previous season he had led the texas league with the lowest strikeout percentage of any hitter .\njoe castle was at his most dangerous with two strikes .\na slider missed low , then gallagher came with a fastball away .\njoe went with the pitch and slapped it hard to left center , a line drive that kept rising until it cleared the wall by five feet .\nas he circled the bases for the third consecutive time , he did so with a record that seemed untouchable .\nno rookie had ever homered in his first three at bats .\njoe castle was from calico rock , ark.\n, a tiny , picturesque village on a bluff above the white river , on the eastern edge of the ozark mountains .\nit was cardinals country , and had been since the days of dizzy dean , an arkansas farm boy and leader of st. louis 's infamous gashouse gang in the 1930s .\nhis brother paul , nicknamed daffy , was also a pitcher on the same team .\nwith a radio on every front porch , calico rock , like countless other towns in the midwest and the deep south , followed the beloved cardinals with a passion during the long , hot summer nights .\nkmox out of st. louis carried the games , and the familiar voices of harry caray and jack buck could be heard on every street and in every car .\non july 12 , though , the dials in calico rock had been switched to wgn out of chicago , and joe 's friends and family were hanging on every pitch .\nthe cardinals-cubs rivalry was the greatest in the national league , and though many in calico rock found it difficult to believe they were rooting for the hated cubs , they were suddenly doing so , and with a fervor .\nafter the first home run , a crowd quickly gathered outside evans drug store on main street .\nthe second home run sent them into a giddy celebration , and the crowd continued to grow .\nwhen joe 's parents , two brothers , their wives and their small children showed up to join the party , they were greeted with bear hugs and cheers .\nthe third home run sent the entire town into orbit .\nthey were also celebrating in the streets and pubs of chicago .\nas stunning as his first three at bats had been , joe 's fourth would endear him to baseball purists forever .\ntop of the ninth , score tied 6-6 , two outs , kessinger standing on third , a tough righthander named ed ramon on the mound .\nramon 's first pitch was a fastball on the outside part of the plate .\njoe waited , then whipped his bat like a broomstick , crushing the ball and lining it a few inches outside the bag at first base , a foul ball but an impressive one .\nernie banks , the cubs ' first base coach , did not have time to react , and if the ball had hit him , he would have been seriously maimed .\nwillie montanez , the phillies ' first baseman , took two steps back .\njoe noticed this and changed his plans .\nthe second pitch was a changeup , high .\nwith the count 1 and 1 , ramon tried another fastball .\nas soon as he released it , joe hesitated a split second , then broke for first base with his bat trailing .\nit tapped the ball and sent it dribbling toward the second baseman , denny doyle , who was as startled as everyone else in the stadium .\nby the time doyle got to the ball , or the ball got to doyle , joe was 10 feet past first base and slowing down along the rightfield foul line .\nkessinger walked home with the eventual winning run .\nthe crowd sat in stunned silence .\nplayers from both teams looked on in disbelief .\nwith a chance to hit four home runs in a game -- a feat baseball had seen only nine times in 100 years -- the kid chose to lay down a perfect drag bunt to score the go-ahead run .\nthe cubs ' announcers , vince lloyd and lou boudreau , had been plowing through the record book during the game and were certain that they had their facts straight .\nthree home runs in the first game of a career was a first .\nfour consecutive hits in a debut game tied a modern-day record , though some rookie had five straight hits back in 1894 .\nchicago won 7-6 , and by the time the game ended virtually every cubs fan was tuned in .\nboudreau promised his listeners that he would soon have joe wired up for a postgame interview .\na half hour after the game was over , boudreau 's voice came across the radio with , \" i 'm in the visitors ' locker room with joe castle , who , as you might guess , is surrounded by reporters .\nhere he is . \"\nsudden silence on main street in calico rock ; no one moved or spoke . \"\njoe , not a bad first game .\nwhat are you thinking right now ? \"\n\" well , i would like to say hello to my family and friends back home in calico rock .\ni wish you could be here .\ni still ca n't believe it . \"\n\" joe , what were you thinking when you stepped to the plate in the second inning ? \"\n\" i was thinking fastball and i was swinging at the first pitch .\ngot lucky , i guess . \"\n\" i got ta ask you -- and i know you 've already been hit with this -- but what were you thinking in the ninth inning ?\nyou had a chance to hit four home runs in a game , yet you bunted . \"\n\" i was thinking about one thing -- getting don home from third for the go-ahead run .\ni love playing baseball , but it 's no fun if you 're not winning . \"\nfew in calico rock went to bed before midnight .\nas promised , my mother awakened me at 6 a.m. so i could watch the early news programs .\ni was hoping for a glimpse of joe castle .\nchannel 4 did a quick rundown on the national league games .\nthe mets had won in atlanta to put them two games over .500 .\nthen there was joe castle sprinting around the bases in philadelphia , once , twice , three times .\nthe drag bunt , though , got as much airtime as the three home runs .\nthe guy could fly .\ni loved it when the mets were on the road .\nmy father was gone , and our house was peaceful and pleasant .\nwhen he was around , the mood was far different .\nhe was a self-absorbed , brooding man with seldom a kind word for any of us .\nhe had never met his potential , and this was always the fault of someone else -- the manager , his teammates , the owners , even the umpires .\non the nights after he pitched , he often came home late and drunk , and that 's when the trouble started .\ni suspected , even at the age of 11 , that my parents would not stay together .\ni know he hit my mother a few times , probably a lot more than i realized .\nand he drank and chased women and lived the hard life of a professional baseball player .\nhe was arrogant and cocky , and from the age of 15 he was accustomed to getting whatever he wanted , because he , warren tracey , could throw a baseball through a brick wall .\ni began visiting the library in white plains to collect stories from the chicago newspapers .\nusing a massive xerox machine near the periodicals section , i made copies at five cents each .\nafter his historic debut joe kept on hitting : he set another record by getting hits in his first 15 big league at bats .\nthe papers were packed with stories and photos , and it was obvious that joe was enjoying the moment .\namong many memorable quotes , he said such things as , \" well , if they keep me in the lineup , i 'll probably hit .750 for the season . \"\nand , \" oh , sure , we have 74 games left .\none home run per game is not out of the question . \"\nand , \" the pennant ?\nthat 's already in the bag , man .\nwe 're thinking about the world series . \"\nthe chicago baseball reporters , a notoriously tough bunch , were in awe and described him as \" cocky but not the least bit arrogant \" and \" at times obviously overwhelmed by what he had done . \"\nhis teammates were stunned but also realistic .\none said , \" he 'll cool off , but let 's hope it takes a few weeks . \"\nthe photos revealed a fresh-faced kid who looked all of 21 and was on top of the world .\nhe was handsome , with deep-set blue eyes and curly , sandy hair , the kind of looks that would soon attract women everywhere he went .\nhe was single and had no significant female in his life , according to one story .\neveryone was falling in love with joe castle .\nmy father was in a foul mood when he left the house , alone .\ni dropped a few hints about riding to the stadium with him , but he was n't listening .\nthe new york papers were relentlessly hyping that day 's game , and one writer , my father 's loudest critic , described the matchup as \" a contrast between youth and age .\nwarren tracey , age 34 and over the hill , versus joe castle , the brightest young star baseball has seen since the arrival of mickey mantle . \"\nit was aug. 24 .\njoe 's big league career was a little more than a month old , and after 31 games he had 62 hits in 119 at bats , with 18 home runs and 25 stolen bases .\nhe had struck out only six times .\nhis batting average of .521 was easily the highest in the majors , though he had not had enough at bats to qualify for the official ranking .\nty cobb , the greatest hitter of all time , had a career average of .367 .\nted williams : .344 .\njoe dimaggio : .325 .\njoe castle was not yet being compared to the great ones , but no rookie had ever hit .521 after 119 at bats .\nmy father had actually been pitching well lately .\nhe beat the braves in his last start , at shea stadium , to even his record at 7-7 .\nwhen he ran out of gas and was pulled in the top of the seventh , he received an impressive ovation from the crowd .\ni was on my feet , eight rows up from the field near the mets ' dugout , clapping and yelling as loud as possible .\nhe tipped his cap to me , and at that moment i realized how much i wanted to adore him .\nfour days later , i cajoled my mother into taking an early train to the city .\ni wanted to watch batting practice and , more important , get my first live look at joe castle .\nwe stepped off the subway at 4:30 , two and a half hours before the first pitch , and the atmosphere outside shea stadium was electric .\ni was surprised at the number of cubs fans , most of them wearing white jerseys with the number 15 across the back .\nshea held 55,000 , and it was already two thirds full when we settled into our seats .\nthe cubs were taking batting practice , and there was a swarm around the cage at home plate .\nron santo , billy williams , jose cardenal and rick monday were in one group , and as they rotated through , i searched the outfield until i saw him .\nas he turned to chase a fly ball , i saw the name castle across the back of his royal blue bp jersey .\nhe caught the ball near the rightfield foul line , and a thousand kids screamed for his autograph .\nhe smiled and waved and jogged back to a group of cubs loitering in right center .\nby then i had read many descriptions of joe castle .\nin high school some scouts had worried that he was too thin .\nhe weighed 170 pounds when he was 18 , and this had bothered a few of the experts .\nhowever , his father had been quoted as saying , \" he 's not even shaving yet .\nlet the boy grow up . \"\nand he was right .\nin the minors joe had filled out , thanks to a combination of nature and hours in the weight room .\nhe had broad shoulders and a 33-inch waist .\nhe wore his game pants tight , and one article in the chicago tribune gossiped about the avalanche of provocative mail he was getting from women across the country .\nas i watched , joe seemed to glide across the outfield .\ni saw my father in the mets ' dugout , sitting alone .\nit was far too early for him to head to the bullpen and begin stretching .\nodd , though , that he was in the dugout .\nusually , at two hours and counting , he was getting a massage from a trainer .\nwith 90 minutes to go he put on his uniform .\nat 75 minutes he left the locker room , walked through the dugout and headed for the bullpen , head down , refusing to look at the opposing dugout .\nthe more i thought about it , the stranger it seemed .\nbaseball players , and especially pitchers , are fanatics about their rituals .\nmy father was 3-1 in his last six starts and four days earlier had pitched perhaps his best game in the last five years .\nwhy would he change things ?\nwhen he walked to the mound in the top of the first , the fans gave my father a rowdy welcome .\nwhen rick monday lined to short on the first pitch , the stadium roared again .\ntwo pitches later , glenn beckert popped out to rightfield , and warren tracey was cruising .\nthe announcer said , \" now batting and playing first base , number 15 , joe castle . \"\ni took a deep breath and began chewing my fingernails .\ni wanted to watch , then i wanted to close my eyes and just listen .\nmy mother patted my knee .\ni envied her apathy .\nnot surprisingly , the first pitch was high and tight .\njoe , batting lefthanded , ducked but did not fall ; nor did he glare at my father .\nit was a simple brushback .\nwelcome to new york .\nthe second pitch was a called strike that looked low , but joe did not react .\nthe third pitch was a fastball that he slapped into the stands near us .\nthe fourth pitch was low and inside .\nthe fifth pitch was a changeup that fooled joe , but he managed to foul it off .\ni was holding my breath with each pitch .\ni was praying for a strikeout , and i was praying for a home run .\nwhy could n't i have both ?\na strikeout now for my father , a home run later for joe , back and forth ?\nin baseball you always get another chance , right ?\ni pondered these things between pitches , a complete nervous wreck .\nthe sixth pitch was a curve that bounced in the dirt .\nthree balls , two strikes .\nshea stadium rocking .\nthe cubs 10 games in first place .\nthe mets 10 games back but winning .\nmy father versus my hero .\njoe fouled off the next eight pitches as the at bat turned into a dramatic duel , with neither player yielding an inch .\nwarren tracey was not about to walk him .\njoe castle was not about to strike out .\nthe 15th pitch was a fastball that looked low , but at the last second joe whipped his bat around , scooped the ball up and launched it to right center , where it cleared the wall by 30 feet .\nwhen i knew the ball was gone , i looked back at the mound and watched my father .\nhe never took his eyes off joe as he rounded first , and when the ball cleared the fence , joe gave himself a quick pump of the fist , as if to say , \" all right ! \"\nit was nothing cocky or out of line, nothing meant to show up the pitcher .\nbut i knew my father , and i knew it was trouble .\nthe score was 1-1 when joe walked to the plate in the top of the third with two outs and no one on .\nthe first pitch was a fastball outside , and when i saw it , i knew what would happen next .\nthe second pitch was just like the first , hard and a foot off the plate .\ni wanted to stand and scream , \" look out , joe ! \"\nbut i could n't move .\nas my father stood on the mound and looked in at his catcher , jerry grote , my heart froze and i could n't breathe .\ni managed to say to my mother , \" he 's gon na hit him . \"\nthe beanball went straight at joe 's helmet , and for a second , for a long , dreadful second that fans and writers would discuss and debate and analyze for decades to come , joe did n't move .\nfor a reason no one , especially joe , would ever understand or be able to explain or re-create or reenact , he simply lost sight of the ball .\nhe had said that he preferred to hit from the left side because he felt as though his right eye picked up the pitches faster , but at that crucial split second his eyes failed him .\nit could have been something beyond the centerfield wall .\nit could have been a slight shift in the lighting .\nhe could have lost the ball as it crossed between my father 's white jersey and home plate .\nno one would ever know , because joe would never remember .\nthe sound of a leather baseball hitting a hard plastic batting helmet is unmistakable .\ni had heard it several times in my games , including twice when i had unintentionally hit batters .\nit is not a sharp bang but more like the striking of a dull object on a hard surface .\nit 's frightening enough , but there is also the immediate belief that the helmet has prevented a serious injury .\nthat was not the sound of joe being hit .\nwhat we heard was the sickening thud of the baseball cracking into flesh and bone .\nfor those of us in the crowd close enough to hear it , the sound would never be forgotten .\ni can , and do , still hear it today .\nthe ball made contact at the corner of joe 's right eye .\nit knocked his helmet off as he fell backward .\nhe caught himself with his hands behind him , on the ground , and paused for a second before passing out .\nthere are so many scrambled images of what happened next .\nthe crowd was stunned .\nthere were gasps and a lot of \" oh , my gods ! \"\nthe home plate umpire was waving for help .\ngrote was standing helplessly over joe .\nthe cubs ' bench was ready to explode ; several players were out of the dugout , screaming and cursing at warren tracey .\nthe cubs fans were booing loudly .\nthe mets fans were silent .\nmy father walked slowly to a spot

{"document": "there 's no pretty way to say this .\ni was present for the death of the pig pictured above .\nit was a grim , sodden day on an upstate new york farm .\na local meat sciences professor named eric explained to the pig 's owners that the most humane method of slaughter was to shoot it at close range between the eyes with a .22 rifle - a stunning blow to knock its central nervous system offline - then slit the main artery so the blood loss would bring about swift , arguably less painful death .\nthe blow would also supposedly reduce the stress on the animal , allowing for better meat quality .\nthe farmers , having researched the matter thoroughly and consulted with the humane animal farm care project , believed this to be true .\nstill , as they stood several yards from the slaughter , half sheltered in the doorway to their goat barn , they flinched at the stark crack of the rifle , and then they cried .\nthey can certainly be excused for that .\nthis was their first slaughter - mine , too - and it 's a shocking act .\nas the farmers ' friend and neighbor , i 'd met porky and bess ( the first death was followed swiftly by a second ) only a handful of times , tossing cucumbers and corncobs from the farm 's vegetable garden into the lopped-off silo in which they were penned .\nthey were affable , loud as all get out and smelled to hell and back .\nit was always a bit bittersweet to check in on them , marking their maturation from wee piglets into fully grown hogs , knowing that that someday soon , they 'd be dispatched and turned into food .\nfor as charming and vibrant as they are , it is simply impractical to keep pigs as pets on a farm .\nthey do n't produce milk like the farm 's dozens of goats , ca n’t be sheared for wool like their sheep , do n’t lay eggs , herd , chase vermin or scare away predators .\nthey 're simply not useful , from a strictly practical standpoint , so to buy and raise a piglet is a commitment to turning it into food .\nthat does n't make the act of their slaughter any easier to watch .\njosh kilmer purcell and brent ridge , the pigs ' owners , are fledgling farmers and yes , they have a reality show about it -

yokosuka naval base would likely be among the pla ’s opening moves .\ncrippling bases in japan would by no means constitute a war winner for beijing .\nbut denying american use of bases near china would shove back the start line for u.s. warships and aircraft by thousands of kilometers to such military hubs as guam and hawaii .\nand the more distance u.s. forces must cover to reach china , the less staying power those same forces would enjoy while operating in the war zone .\nfinally , opportunities beckon .\nperceptions of american overdependence on forward bases could tempt the chinese to hit first and hard .\nno naval base in asia rivals yokosuka ’s strategic location , physical infrastructure , world-class repair facilities , and highly-skilled local workforce .\nchinese strategists believe , perhaps rightly , that if the pla could knock out yokosuka , the u.s. fleet would need to fall back to hawaii or even san diego to meet its critical logistical needs .\na preemptive chinese missile campaign , so goes this reasoning , could deliver a massive blow to the logistical foundations of u.s. power projection in asia .\nby disrupting the supply system and degrading repair capabilities , beijing may hope to choke off the american capacity to conduct combat operations at the outset .\nstill , as events after japan ’s bombardment of pearl harbor show , an operational triumph alone does not beget strategic success .\nindeed , disaster awaited imperial japan .\nthe japanese diplomats accepting unconditional surrender onboard the battleship missouri would surely have agreed .\nit is unclear whether beijing has thought through the likely strategic fallout following a missile blitzkrieg against u.s. forces on allied soil .\nbut , the pla ’s continuing missile buildup suggests that chinese leaders might succumb to the false promise of a quick military fix that so beguiled japanese strategists seven decades ago .", "summary": "by toshi yoshihara , special to

tunnel prompted engineers to include various features designed to alleviate claustrophobia and tiredness . \"\nthe sheer length of tunnel -- which takes 20 minutes to drive through -- led to innovation in the use of behavioral science and driver psychology in the design to reduce driver fatigue and improve safety , \" says sykes . \"\nthis resulted in large , colorfully lit caverns every six kilometers , providing points of interest and a unique driver experience . \"\nlength : 24.5 kilometers ( 15.2 miles ) fast fact : engineers separated the tunnel into different sections to give

hand .\nthree died during the construction process but the tunnel transformed the village and became a tourist attraction in its own right . \"\nthis tunnel is beautiful and a tribute the tenacity of the villagers who built it , \" says thomas at ramboll . \"\nfor me it emphasizes how tunnel construction can enhance the environment as well as bringing huge benefits for society .\nat the same time

increase in the number of militia groups operating in the united states -- from 42 to 127 such groups at the year 's end .\none of these , the 3 percenters , was co-founded by mike vanderboegh , who

{"document": "washington ( cnn ) -- in the bitter political debate over health care reform two years ago , one of the most contentious issues was a proposed advisory board that would recommend how to achieve needed but as-yet-unreachable medicare savings .\nopponents dubbed the independent payment advisory board ( ipab ) a \" death panel \" that would ration medical coverage for senior citizens based on cost and effectiveness , rather than decisions reached between patient and doctor .\nsupporters called such rhetoric overheated and misleading , arguing the advisory board was necessary to motivate a reluctant health care industry to adopt cost-cutting reforms that congress had proven unwilling or unable to impose .\nnow the house will consider repealing the advisory board provision this week in an election-year move that rekindles the fiery emotions of the health care fight back in 2009 and 2010 .\nwhile the repeal effort is expected to eventually fall short , it gives opponents of health care reform a rallying point for their continued efforts to undermine the 2010 law .\nsome of the rhetoric from two years earlier has re-emerged , such as warnings of a government takeover of health care . \"\nwhat we oppose is the president deciding who gets what , \" rep. tom price , r-georgia , told a news conference wednesday .\nearlier this week , republican rep. scott desjarlais of tennessee told reporters that the ipab panel was \" designed to put a washington bureaucrat between the patient and their doctor . \"\nthat 's not the intent or the reality of the advisory board , insisted dr. donald berwick , the former administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services .\nfor example , the law targeted by the repeal effort specifically forbids the advisory board from rationing health care to reduce spending . \"\nwe 're in a very polarized era .\nit 's hard to have rational conversations with people \" on the issue , berwick told cnn .\npaul van de water , a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities , said this week that \" charges that the board is going to be able to deny people care are just flat out wrong . \"\n\" the law makes every effort to restrict the board so that it ca n't do that , \" van de water said . \"\nand in fact , if anything , the charge is the opposite of the truth . \"\nthe 15-member ipab board would comprise independent experts to recommend medicare cost reductions starting in 2015 if congress and the health care industry and insurers fail to agree on $ 300 billion in savings called for in the health care reform law .\ndesigned as a nonpolitical solution in the event of legislative stalemate , the panel 's recommendations do not require congressional approval but can be offset by congress .\nsome critics , including democrats who back health care reform , cite the independent board 's relative autonomy as a reason for eliminating it .\nin addition , republican sponsors have added long-desired tort reform provisions against frivolous lawsuits to offset the cost of eliminating the panel intended to bring medicare savings .\nhowever , the legal lobby and many democrats oppose tort reforms , raising questions about the final makeup of the bill .\naccording to berwick , opposition to the ipab panel breaks down into three groups : a \" significant minority \" that hates the 2010 health care reform law and wants to scare people about it ; political opponents of president barack obama trying to hurt his re-election chances , and health care providers and insurers \" doing quite well in the status quo \" who are unwilling to commit to medicare reforms .\ndespite such opposition , no one disputes the need to change medicare in order to keep it solvent in coming decades , as baby boomers reach retirement age and flood its ranks .\nrepublicans who have long opposed medicare want to lower the cost by eventually making it a subsidized program instead of a government-run system .\nthe house republican budget for 2013 made public tuesday would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee-for-service medicare plan or opting for a medicare-approved private plan , all of which would be available via a new medicare exchange .\nno matter which plan they chose , including the traditional medicare plan , seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice .\nthe 2010 health care reform law sought cost reductions in medicare through more efficient delivery of services .\nfor example , it envisioned increased collaboration through electronic medical records to reduce repetitive and costly tests , as well as basing reimbursement on quality of care rather than quantity of services provided . \"\nit 's conceivable you could ratchet down on payments for routine mris or cat scans and use some of that money to shore up payments to providers and ... make the whole system a little more efficient , \" noted uwe reinhardt , a professor of economics and public affairs at princeton university 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs .\nunder the law , the ipab panel would step in if targeted cost reductions went unmet .\nthose seeking repeal of the advisory board say it will lead to indiscriminate cost-cutting rather than the intended reforms to maintain medicare 's long-term solvency .\nrep. nan hayworth , r-new york , who practiced ophthalmology for 16 years prior to her election to congress in 2010 , said medicare reimbursements already were being lowered to a point where some physicians can not afford to treat medicare patients . \"\nthat is the last thing our seniors need , \" hayworth said wednesday . \"\nin many practices across the country , that threat will only increase with ipab . \"\nrep. tim griffin , r-arkansas , said at a monday news conference that the advisory board \" will do nothing to change how medicare works , \" adding \" it will simply say we 've run out of money , and now we 're cutting . \"\nthe american medical association , a major physician 's advocacy organization , also wants to repeal the advisory board even though it supported the broader health care reform law .\nit already wrestles with what has been a 15-year problem involving medicare reimbursements that exemplifies the difficulty of reforming the program .\nthe medicare sustainable growth rate provision enacted in 1997 limits increases in medicare costs to the same rate of growth in the gross domestic product .\nunder the formula , the costs have repeatedly risen higher than planned .\nrather than cutting payments to medicare doctors , congress has regularly authorized extra money to make up the difference , with the latest so-called \" doc fix \" set to expire at the end of 2012 .\nthat means doctors face a 30 % cut in medicare reimbursements from the government in january , and now the ipab panel would be empowered to recommend steeper cuts , ama board chairman dr. robert wah told cnn in a telephone interview .\nthe ama wants congress to stabilize funding for medicare reimbursements for five years to allow doctors time to work out reforms outlined in the 2010 health care legislation .\naccording to wah , the fear is that the ipab panel will recommend across-the-board spending cuts that drive doctors away from medicare patients while failing to inspire the necessary reforms . \"\na board that does n't have to answer to anybody and has the latitude to make dramatic cuts has consequences for our patients , \" said wah , later adding : \" it 's very hard to do that kind of innovation when there is uncertainty and the threat of large cuts . \"\nfor berwick , the question is , \" how do you create the political and social will for uncomfortable changes ? \"\n\" the evidence so far is that motivation solely from inside health care , changing itself , is insufficient , \" he said .\ncnn 's laurie ure contributed to this report .", "summary": "the house will vote thursday on eliminating a key provison of health care reform -- a new advisory board on medicare savings ."}

{"document": "president obama delivers remarks on financial reform thursday .\nwashington ( cnn ) -- president obama already was planning to put a heavy focus on jobs and the economy in next week 's state of the union address , but his top aides are signaling that pivot is going to be even sharper in the wake of the democrats ' stunning election defeat in massachusetts .\nwhite house press secretary robert gibbs noted the president has been dealing with the financial crisis long before tuesday 's senate race , but he acknowledged the administration could have done a better job of conveying that message to the public and will now redouble its efforts . \"\nthe president works each and every day on making our economy stronger and putting us in a position to where we 're creating jobs , businesses are hiring again , \" gibbs said . \"\ni can certainly assure the american people that that is the chief focus of the president of the united states . \"\nthat message , however , was at least partially obscured by obama 's heavy focus on overhauling health care for much of his first year .\nat least three key themes are emerging ahead of the state of the union to help reframe the second year .\n1 .\nthe president is pushing a more scaled-back health plan , which might be fleshed out in next wednesday 's address .\none option would be for the house of representatives to take up the senate-passed bill that would give health coverage to an estimated 31 million people who are uninsured .\nbut such a move would be contingent upon the senate passing a second piece of legislation to make major changes to the first bill .\nthat could be a major wrinkle , and house speaker nancy pelosi already is balking at this approach .\nthat 's why white house aides have been privately floating a second option that would be much less ambitious .\nthe emerging plan would cobble together several basic insurance reforms that many republicans have expressed support for , including a ban on excluding people for pre-existing conditions and stopping insurance companies from dropping coverage if you get sick .\nsuch a plan would be reaching out to republicans by dialing back the $ 1 trillion price tag of obama 's original health care push , so it would need to be sweetened for disappointed liberals .\none way to do that is adding an expansion of medicaid to cover a few million people who are uninsured , far short of obama 's original goal but something that might be sold as a strong step forward . \"\ni would advise that we try to move quickly to coalesce around those elements of the package that people agree on , \" obama told george stephanopoulos of abc news .\nbut look out , there 's some lightning coming from the left .\npaul krugman , the liberal economist and new york times columnist , ripped into the president after the abc interview for allegedly abandoning major reform . \"\ni 'm pretty close to giving up on mr. obama , who seems determined to confirm every doubt i and others ever had about whether he was ready to fight for what his supporters believed in , \" krugman blogged .\n2 .\nlook for a series of presidential events on jobs and the economy , starting friday when obama heads to lorain county , ohio , outside cleveland .\nobama , a huge sports fan , will visit the riddell sporting goods factory to witness the production of baseball and football helmets , but the trip will be serious business because it 's one of the hardest-hit parts of the country in terms of unemployment .\nthe highlight of the visit is likely to be a town hall meeting at a community college , giving obama a chance for an \" i feel your pain \" moment .\nbut there 's also political risk from a town hall meeting so quickly after the massachusetts results because this could be a chance for average citizens to vent on the president .\nbut gibbs noted the president will be prepared to face angry voters because the economic anxiety is not a new phenomenon .\nhe said obama saw it on full display as a presidential candidate , so it did not just start with republican sen.-elect scott brown 's victory this week . \"\nwhen we go to ohio ... you are going to talk to real people that have n't lost their -- some of them may have lost their jobs since the massachusetts election , or may have even lost their jobs since massachusetts called a special election , \" said gibbs . \"\nbut the circumstances that exist in this country that cause anger and frustration about their economic situations is n't new . \"\n3 .\nthe final major theme to expect is obama as wall street-basher as he steps up his push for major financial regulatory reform .\nbig banks are deeply unpopular , making them a fat target for the president .\nlast week he rolled out a new fee on big banks to recoup taxpayer bailout funds , and then thursday he unveiled tough new regulations to limit the risk from large banks .\nthe point is to try and prevent wall street from operating under the same rules that nearly led to a depression , but the message is more direct : obama is ready to stand up for the little guy against the barons on wall street . \"\nif these folks want a fight , \" obama said defiantly , \" this is a fight i 'm ready to have . \"\nobama also railed against the \" binge of irresponsibility \" and declared : \" we simply ca n't return to business as usual . \"\nit 's a new crisp message from a president vowing to shake up wall street .\nhe 's talking about jobs on main street , while putting the muddled health care debate a bit on the back burner .\nsome of obama 's supporters may be wondering : what took him so long ?", "summary": "president obama already was planning to put a heavy focus on jobs and the economy in next week

school in the boston area .\nand it 's easy to see why those extraordinary images made us all more sensitive to the everyday possibility of danger .\nbut the big picture is this : in a very unusual set of circumstances , two bad guys set off bombs .\nthey killed three people , and injured many more .\nthe people of boston refused to be terrorized , and they worked with the police to catch those responsible in a few short days .\neven under these extraordinary circumstances , our system worked .\nbad people did bad things , but we found the suspects and we caught them .\nsurveillance cameras of course played a part .\nthey probably allowed the suspects to be identified more quickly , and they will surely provide useful evidence at the surviving suspect 's criminal trial .\nwould more cameras have meant quicker apprehension of the suspects ?\nthere 's no evidence to suggest this .\nand it 's important to remember that there are already lots of cameras in boston .\nand though some may believe that blanketing our public areas with video surveillance will make us safer , we should reject this call .\nfirst , surveillance cameras are expensive .\nthey are costly to install and maintain , and in a time of limited budgets , they could be mistaken for an adequate substitute for human police officers on the street .\nshould we trade off the cost of human police ( or schools , or roads , or lower taxes ) for even more robotic surveillance eyes ?\ni do n't think so .\nbecome a fan of cnnopinion stay up to date on the latest opinion , analysis and conversations through social

marathon , nor did london 's more extensive network of cameras deter the 2005 subway bombings .\nboston 's talented police commissioner , edward davis , put it best right after last monday 's events when he said that despite the city 's extensive security preparations , little short of a \" police state \" could have stopped the attacks .\nit is to davis ' great credit that as police commissioner he did n't want a police state .\nthis brings me to my third point .\nsurveillance cameras , or other government surveillance technologies , have costs in civil liberties as well as in money .\nsurveillance cameras like we already have in boston are like having a police officer with perfect memory on every street corner .\nit might be relatively easy to say that even more video cameras would amplify that effect while posing little threat to privacy .\nbut surveillance cameras are getting better , and it 's now possible to pair them with facial recognition technology linked to state driver 's license databases .\nwhen this technology matures , it 'll give the police the power to monitor all of our movements in public linked to our real identities , not just to our anonymous faces .\nsuch a system would conceivably give the government increased power over us , power that could be used not just to monitor , but in some cases , potentially , to blackmail , persuade or discriminate .\npolice on every corner might be one thing , but police who can instantly see your identity papers and constantly track you are another .\nwe might decide we want a limited version of this system , but we need to talk about these things now , before well-meaning local governments make the decision for us .\nit might be difficult to hear , but we ca n't be perfectly safe all the time .\nand part of living in a free and open society means that occasionally some people will abuse that freedom .\nthat 's why we have a criminal justice system in which the police investigate crimes .\nit 's better to punish the people who abuse their freedom and harm others than to take everyone 's liberties away and subject us all to the eye of the state .\nless privacy , less civil liberties .\nbeing constantly observed might make us feel slightly safer , but this would be only an illusion of safety .\nhistory has shown repeatedly that broad government surveillance powers

of children from guatemala , honduras and el salvador who have , in recent months , streamed across the texas-mexico border .\naccording to media reports , the group is a mixture of unaccompanied

fend off encroachment by mexican drug cartels looking for new outposts from which to operate .\nthat is the best theory about why the surge is occurring .\nthe most far-fetched theory comes from restrictionists and nativists who insist that what enticed these children from central america to cross the u.s.-mexico border is an expectation that obama is poised to use his executive power to grant a kind of \" amnesty \" to millions of undocumented .\nif people in central america believe that , they could be the only folks in this hemisphere who do .\nobama has never been particularly interested in proposing an immigration reform plan to congress .\nand he has spent the last few years resisting calls to use executive power to act unilaterally to stop deportations .\nhouse majority leader eric cantor had taken just about every position one can take on the immigration issue , but recently said he would work with obama to allow undocumented young people to stay in the united states .\nnow that has been defeated in the primary election by a conservative in his home district in virginia , immigration reform is all but dead .\nbesides , from all appearances , the border kids

protect the democratic experience and preserve the integrity of the electoral process ... i call on the independent high electoral commission to immediately respond to these blocs ' demands in order

groups including the united nations , saying it was transparent .\nthe vote count was open and took place at count centers , they said .\nit was attended by representatives from the political blocs , who could have filed complaints within 48 hours .\nsome 2,000 complaints were filed and are being investigated , the commission officials said .\nhowever , they said a recount can not take place based on unfounded accusations .\nsuch a process would involve bringing in some 300,000 employees who took part in the vote process and in counting the ballots , al-aboodi said , adding , \" that is near impossible . \"\nif a political bloc has doubt about the results in a certain polling center , it can not ask for a citywide or a national recount , al-haidari said -- that would be like asking for

.\nbaghdad province , which includes the capital city , is the most populous , and represents 68 of the 325 parliament seats .\nbut in the overall vote count , former interim prime minister ayad allawi 's al-iraqia bloc has moved ahead by more than 7,000 votes , according to the partial preliminary results .\nallawi 's bloc holds the lead in five provinces .\nthe parliamentary seats will be distributed in each province through an allocation formula , not by popular vote .\nthe results released sunday are based on 95 percent of the votes counted .\nthe 95 percent figure is the national total -- the percentage counted in individual provinces varies .\nal-aboodi said earlier the commission canceled 57 polling stations for voting irregularities and another for a procedural violation .\nthe canceled stations do not affect the turnout figures or results , he said .\nabout 6,200 candidates from more than 80 political entities were on the ballot for seats in parliament .\nthe

volatile nineveh province , which is allotted the second-largest share of parliamentary seats after baghdad province .\nallawi , who served as prime minister in 2004 , is a secular shiite and his bloc includes prominent sunni arab politicians , including vice president tariq al-hashimi .\nthe shiite vote appeared largely divided between al-maliki 's state of law alliance and the iraqi national

{"document": "isis ' most recent successes have come hundreds of miles apart .\nits capture of ramadi in iraq and palmyra in syria can be explained by its tactics and structure , the weakness or exhaustion of opponents and the support or acquiescence among enough sunnis in both countries .\nit may also have benefited , according to some analysts , from cynical power plays in baghdad .\neven so , taking ramadi and holding it are two different things .\nevidence from previous battles suggests that isis does n't do defense as well as offense , and it is still vastly outnumbered by iraqi forces .\nbut the longer isis fighters are entrenched anywhere , the more difficult they are to expel , and the iraqi security forces clearly are n't capable of the task alone .\nin syria , the seizure of palmyra gives isis access to the main roads to homs and damascus and nearby gas fields .\nit also confirms a shift by isis to focus on territory held by the regime of bashar al-assad in western and central syria after a series of defeats at the hands of kurdish forces supported by coalition airpower in the north .\nthe term was coined in 2003 to describe the technological power of the u.s. invasion of iraq .\nbut it can equally be applied to the way isis behaves on the battlefield , striking the enemy with massive explosive force .\nback in february , kurdish commanders near mosul told cnn how isis had sent more than a dozen fuel tankers converted into massive vehicle-borne suicide bombs against their positions .\na similar tactic was used to break the resistance of iraqi security forces in ramadi .\nmichael knights , an analyst with the washington institute for near east policy who has spent much time in iraq , says it 's \" unsurprising that the isf in ramadi finally cracked when struck with a hammer blow -- namely , 28 suicide car bombs in three days , including at least six massive 15-ton armored truck bombs in a single attack . \"\nthere were also rumors that thousands of isis fighters had come to ramadi from syria , likely spread by isis ' adept use of social media to sow fear .\nthere is another psychological dimension to isis ' threat : enemy soldiers know that they will be killed in cold blood if captured -- probably in gruesome fashion .\nat tikrit last june , around hit earlier this year , in palmyra in syria last week , enemy soldiers and other adversaries have been dealt with mercilessly .\nsummary executions -- en masse -- are part of its mode of warfare .\nafter seizing a syrian military base near raqqa last july , it beheaded dozens of syrian soldiers , posting videos of the barbarity .\naccording to the syrian observatory for human rights , it has now begun a similar reign of terror around palmyra , executing hundreds of captured soldiers and regime sympathizers .\nmilitary analysts have been impressed by isis ' military tactics and flexibility .\none senior kurdish commander told cnn earlier this year that it was a \" formidable \" enemy that demanded respect .\nit has commanders with experience and local knowledge who served in saddam hussein 's military and others who have fought in chechnya and afghanistan .\nisis has perfected the art of \" misleading \" the enemy , with complex diversionary attacks and mixed signals about its intentions pulling enemies this way and that .\nas it prepared to attack ramadi , it also began offensive operations around baiji and north of baghdad , deterring or delaying reinforcement of ramadi by the isf .\nfew analysts expect isis to launch an attack on baghdad : it knows that its numbers and the capital 's vast shia population would make it a mission impossible .\nbut a devastating campaign of suicide bombings and attacks on the fringes of the city ( around abu ghraib , for example ) would further tie down iraqi forces .\nturkish analyst metin gurcan has noted isis ' \" fluid and decentralized command and control structure ; novel hybrid military tactics blending conventional warfare with terrorist tactics , [ and ] effective use of armored platforms in offensive operations . \"\nit has recently used those tactics in central syria , beginning with insurgent-style ambushes of government troops , probing weaknesses and killing captives .\nthen , in mid-may , it launched a more conventional offensive to take territory .\nisis is also more difficult to target because its units are very small and swift .\ngurcan says it frequently deploys \" eight to 10 men teams carrying out building-by-building , block-by-block clear and hold operations in urban terrain . \"\nisis ' child soldiers : what will happen to the ' cubs of the caliphate ' ?\nin iraq and syria , isis is one of the most disciplined players on the battlefield .\nits opponents include shifting coalitions of syrian rebel factions , a syrian military that is fraying in its fourth year of war and a hollowed-out iraqi army .\nisis appears to have calculated that exhaustion and desertion in the syrian armed forces makes this the ideal time to focus on regime targets rather than a war of attrition with kurds in the northeast and fratricidal battles against other jihadist groups such as al nusra .\nwhile there is no indication that the syrian military is about to be overwhelmed , it is stretched .\nthe regime has moved to crack down on draft-dodging and compensate families of soldiers killed in action .\nit is also more reliant than before on the lebanese shia militia hezbollah and iranian support .\nin iraq , units tasked with defending ramadi had a vast numerical advantage over isis .\nbut the evidence suggests the mix of forces -- police , army and tribal militia -- was poorly led , suffering from low morale and in some instances poorly equipped . \"\nin the 11 months since mosul fell , only a tiny number of new local forces have been raised in ramadi -- a weak brigade of 2,000 federal police and a new 1,000-strong unit of tribal paramilitaries , \" says michael knights .\nsunni tribal fighters had the motivation to defend ramadi but were not well integrated with other units and lacked the sort of anti-tank weapons needed to deal with isis truck bombs .\nthe sunni tribes have spent a year pleading for more weapons from the federal government -- to little avail , they say , despite repeated promises .\nto some observers , the failure to provide weapons to sunni militia was no accident .\nsimply put , they say , some shia politicians were not concerned about ramadi falling because it posed no threat to the shia heartland .\nnor did they want to see sunni tribes turned into effective fighting units .\nwinning back ramadi would then depend on deploying shia militia known as popular mobilization units , something prime minister abadi had tried to avoid . \"\nthe shock caused by the fall of ramadi helped to provide the last push in ending the u.s. and abadi 's resistance to the reflagging of the militias under the banner of iraq 's security forces while keeping [ their ] structure intact , \" according to middle east briefing .\nthat is exactly what is happening : the shia militia is taking the leading role in encircling ramadi as well as preparing to evict isis from the city of baiji and its nearby refinery farther north .\nbut isis trades on the distrust among iraqi sunnis toward the government in baghdad .\niraqi soldier recalls battle with isis for ramadi the fact that tens of thousands of sunni civilians have fled ramadi for an uncertain fate in searing temperatures is a good indication that most are terrified of isis .\nbut at the same time , some sunni tribes are equivocal about fighting for iraq .\niraq 's deputy prime minister , saleh al-mutlaq , who is himself a sunni , told cnn on monday : \" what is after that ?\nare they going to live in an area which is going to rebuild again ?\nis there going to be a reconciliation ?\nare they going to be included in the government ? \"\nu.s. policymakers see the same dilemma .\nas one senior u.s. official put it this week : \" the rapid integration of the sunni tribes into the fight alongside other iraqi forces is essential as they will be the most invested in fighting for their areas . \"\ndespite hundreds of airstrikes on its military infrastructure , isis continues to function as a rudimentary government in places such as mosul and tal afar in iraq , and raqqa in syria .\nit provides security -- on its terms -- and basic services , and has shown itself capable of raising money to finance them .\nit constantly posts videos of \" life as normal \" in places such as mosul : well-ordered streets , markets functioning , hospitals open .\nthe reality is surely less rosy , but a year after falling to isis , mosul still has more than a million residents .\nisis ' control of oil and gas fields in syria and iraq has been degraded by airstrikes , but it continues to seize energy sources , most recently the syrian gas fields of al-hil and al-ark , in addition to nearby phosphate mines .\nit has also developed a lucrative trade in antiquities through the black market .\nisis has also concentrated its advances on the upper euphrates and tigris rivers and now controls huge tracts of both rivers -- critical resources for iraq and syria .\nif isis is serious about becoming a self-sustaining state , access to water is vital .\nso is control over dams and locks as a tool of war .\nby draining the euphrates near ramadi this week , isis has opened up new attack routes to the east -- provoking a renewed exodus of civilians .\nhow isis controls daily life isis is also able to leverage its hold on territory in syria and iraq because it can exploit different enemies with different goals , and move fighters and supplies across international borders .\nin september , it lost the rabia crossing between syria and iraq north of mosul , but it has compensated by tightening its grip over anbar and taking the last border post with iraq still held by the syrian government at al-tanf .\njessica mcfale of the institute for the study of war writes that even if the iraqis eventually evict isis from mosul ( surely a distant goal ) , \" isis will constitute a permanent threat to mosul if its dominion over the jazeera desert in western iraq persists .\nthis outcome is guaranteedwhile isis controls eastern syria . \"\nisis ' desire to attack , even when it 's defending gains , might yet be its achilles ' heel .\nit has thrown fighters into futile situations , such as around kobani in syria last year and at eski mosul in january , even when the odds are heavily stacked against it .\nbut on other occasions -- notably in tikrit -- it has ultimately retreated to save manpower , using snipers , dozens of ieds and barriers such as downed bridges , trenches and berms to slow the enemy 's advance .\nmichael knights says isis suffers from what he calls \" chronic tactical restlessness , \" an almost pathological need to take the initiative and attack the enemy , even when -- as in kurdish regions earlier this year -- success was highly unlikely .\nmetin gurcan , writing in al-monitor , says that isis has so far benefited from the arm 's - length coordination of airstrikes and major ground operations .\nhe recommends \" close air support that can only be provided by intense cooperation between ground troops and air units . \"\nbut that would entail risk and commitment that has so far been avoided .\nhow isis makes and takes money when isis units advanced rapidly through iraq a year ago , they seized thousands of square kilometers in kurdish areas they were ultimately unable to hold .\ngiven the number of isis fighters and their vast geographical spread in iraq and syria , the group is vulnerable to overreach it could have its lines of communications cut and its holdings divided , especially since its ambitious move into central syria amid the more complex mosaic of factions there .\neven if higher estimates of isis fighting strength are accepted -- around 100,000 according to some iraqi observers -- it is a huge area to hold and govern .\nif the real number is much lower , the job seems unsustainable .\nwithout better intelligence on the ground , it 's difficult to estimate with confidence how many fighters isis has and their different motives for fighting , how many have been killed and how quickly they are being replaced .\nu.s. officials say some 13,000 isis fighters have been killed by airstrikes since august out of a force of some 30,000 .\nother observers say it 's implausible the group could have lost nearly half of its strength and still be so effective across such a huge area .\nisis now has a new challenge to factor in .\nother jihadist groups in syria , such as jabhat al nusra and ansar al islam , have essentially declared war on it in northern aleppo .\nansar al islam , in a statement issued this week , said that if there was no \" decisive and real position to deter their aggression , then it is the beginning of the end . \"\nisis ' leadership is still determined to expand its caliphate in iraq and syria , seeing it as a step toward an even greater regional presence .\nit frequently talks of \" remaining and expanding \" in its publications .\nbut it is fighting from the suburbs of baghdad to the fringes of damascus , on syria 's borders with turkey and lebanon .\naccording to the syrian observatory for human rights , isis now controls some 95,000 square kilometers in syria .\nand its credibility rests with holding cities .\na caliphate that includes mosul , raqqa , ramadi and palmyra demands attention in a way that a caliphate limited to the anbar desert does not .\nand holding and administering cities , unless their inhabitants leave or are expelled , takes a lot of resources .\nbut the same challenge confronts its opponents .\neven if ramadi can be retaken -- and there 's little progress to report so far -- persuading the displaced to return home and providing governance and services is a huge challenge , one readily acknowledged by president barack obama 's special envoy , gen. john allen .\nisis has a very deliberate policy of wrecking the places from which it retreats .\nbut if this challenge is not met , isis would soon be back .\ninteractive : the

his computer skills to commit what the government called treason .\nit was a far cry from his beginnings .\nhailing from the small oklahoma town of crescent , population less than 1,300 , he was a gearhead with a love of computer games and a passion for current events , his friends and family told cnn in 2011 .\nafter working a series of part-time jobs and , at one point , living out of his car , he joined the army in 2007 .\nbut it was a tough acclimation , his friends later said , in large part because of the military 's \" do n't ask , do n't tell \" policy .\naccording to friends and his own writings on the internet , manning is openly gay .\nthen , in 2009 , manning deployed to iraq .\nhe was at forward operating base hammer in southeast baghdad , where he worked as an analyst reviewing possible threats to u.s. troops .\naccording to fein , the prosecutor , within two weeks of his arrival in iraq , manning began working with wikileaks founder julian assange over what to leak and how to do it .\nassange has taken refuge at the ecuadorean embassy in london to avoid extradition to sweden to face questioning in sex-crimes allegations , charges he claims are a ruse by allies of washington to arrest him and then extradite him to the united states to face charges .\nmanning spent hours at work during off-hours downloading documents , fein said .\nmanning , the prosecutor said , was well aware of the military 's policy about divulging classified material and the repercussions of doing it .\nthe soldier had even taught classes about protecting the material , fein said . \"\nmanning had no allegiance to the united states , \" fein told the court last week , adding that he was \" not a whistle-blower ; he was a traitor . \"\nbut manning 's attorney offered another picture , one in which the war deeply affected his client .\nit began , his attorney told the court , after an attack on a convoy with his comrades .\na roadside bomb exploded beneath a car full of civilians that had pulled aside to let the military vehicles pass .\nalthough members of his 305th military intelligence battalion were not hurt , coombs said , at least one civilian was killed .\nthat changed manning 's outlook on the war , his lawyer said .\nhe \" struggled . \"\nhe was further disturbed by the \" collateral murder \" video , the attorney said . \"\ndid they all deserve to die ?\nthat is what pfc.\nmanning is seeing when he watches this , \" coombs told the judge after playing the video in court .\nit was for those reasons , according to coombs , that manning then started selecting information to reveal , believing that it would be better if it were public .\ncoombs said his client was selective in the information he diverted from a controlled-access computer system where he worked as an \" all source \" intelligence analyst .\nmanning came to the attention of authorities in may 2010 after a confidential informant , later identified as ex-hacker adrian lamo of sacramento , california , came forward with a stunning story .\nit began with a message said to be posted by manning , using the instant message handle \" bradass87 . \"\n\" if you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8 + months , what would you do ? \"\nit read .\naccording to testimony , that was purportedly part of a string of instant messages that a person sent to lamo , who was convicted in 2004 for hacking the new york times , microsoft and lexis-nexis computer systems .\nover a period of days beginning on may 22 , 2010 , lamo testified , he and the man identified as manning instant-messaged about the release of the documents and videos .\nlamo has said he reported manning to authorities .\narmy criminal investigation command special agent david shaver has testified that the chat logs that lamo provided to the army largely matched chat logs found on manning 's computer in iraq .\nmanning was arrested in iraq on may 27 , 2010 , and then transferred to kuwait before being returned to the united states two months later .\nhe was formally charged on july 6 , 2010 , with violations of the uniform code of military justice and the espionage act .\nin march 2011 , the military revised the alleged violations and filed 22 charges against manning .\nhe was held for months by the military in solitary confinement , a move that drew sharp criticism from amnesty international and other human rights groups .\nit even cost p.j.\ncrowley his job as state department spokesman after he said in march 2011 that the conditions of the soldier 's detention were \" ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid . \"\ncrowley resigned just days later amid reports that the obama administration was furious over his suggestion that manning was being treated badly .\npresident barack obama publicly defended the conditions of the soldier 's detention , telling reporters that he had been assured by the pentagon that the conditions were appropriate and met basic standards .\neven so , the outcry grew , with academics , medical professionals and others weighing in as manning 's attorney filed motions to move the soldier from the marine corps prison at quantico .\nafter 11 months in solitary confinement , manning was transferred to fort leavenworth .\nhe has since been moved to a jail at fort meade .\nduring closing statements last week , attorneys on both sides pointed to a picture of a smiling manning .\neach had their own take on the man in the cross- dressing image that was taken in 2010 while he was on leave -- just weeks before his arrest . \"\nthis is a gleeful , grinning pfc.\nmanning , \" who had little regard for his allegiance to the united states , fein told the court .\nbut coombs told the judge that picture showed a situation in which manning could \" be himself . \"\nthe only question now is what portrait of manning the judge will offer with a verdict .\ncnn 's barbara starr ,

seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report , but employers are getting smarter and finding references you did n't provide .\nso , what 's the deal ?\ndo references matter ?\ndo employers even check them anymore ?\nwhat 's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer ?\nwho are the best people to include as references ?\nand , if an employer does n't call any of your references , is it a bad sign ?\nwhile the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer , overall , yes , references do still matter .\nthe process has just changed . \"\nreferences play a huge role in the hiring process , perhaps now more than ever , \" said heather r. huhman , founder and president of come recommended , an online community that connects internship and entry-level job candidates with employers . \"\noftentimes , hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview , only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again .\nby checking a candidate 's references , hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company .\nin this economy , where hiring budgets are slim , every hire must be a great fit . \"\nprovided references are no guarantee though the majority of employers do check references , others skip this step .\nnot only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer , but jack harsh , adjunct professor at the university of richmond robins school of business , said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references . \"\n[ hiring ] decisions can not be based on information that is discriminatory in nature , so to avoid any liability , the checks are forgone , \" harsh said . \"\nsadly , the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun . \"\nsteve langerud , director of career development at depauw university , adds that sometimes , the quality of references is benign . \"\neveryone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees , but in the end , they offer little substance to a new employer , \" he says . \"\nlegally , they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees .\ni think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields . \"\nlangerud warns that just because an employer is n't checking personal references the traditional way does n't mean he is n't checking references at all . \"\nemployers are more likely to check the informal , but tangible , behavioral reference sources like linkedin , facebook , credit history [ or ] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates , \" he said . \"\ncandidates should be much more intentional about crafting a professional identity that serves the role of a ' reference ' but within the context of the work , profession and colleagues you seek to engage .\nit eliminates the weaknesses inherent in the old style of references that become so watered down they are useless . \"\nthe last thing you want to do is give an employer useless references , but many job seekers make the mistake of not taking the time to thoughtfully choose the right people to speak on their behalf , said elaine varelas , managing partner for keystone partners , an outplacement and talent management consulting firm . \"\nyou want people who can speak to your role as a professional , not as a nice neighbor , \" varelas said . \"\ncandidates can make their references count by prepping them to discuss their specific skills as they relate to the job and the impact they brought to the job , which can be just the differentiation needed in this highly competitive market . \"\nharsh agrees that when he receives a résumé with references attached , he gives them virtually no weight . \"\nthey seldom are specific to the role my company seeks and are not meaningful in considering qualifications or traits of successful candidate , \" he said .\nfinally , when it comes to protocol for submitting references , the process has changed as well .\nit used to be that applicants sent them in with their other application materials , but now , varelas says , you should wait to provide references until you are asked . \"\nmost companies do not want your references until the end of the process and they will let you know when to provide a list of names and contact information .\ndo not send written references , \" she said . \"\nthese do not offer the highest impact as they are not specific on how you will fit into the job you are pursuing .\nit is better to spend your time preparing your references for the kinds of questions they will be asked , and what they can do to help you close an offer . \"\nharsh , varelas and langerud offer these 10 tips to ensure you do everything right when it comes to providing references : 1 .\ninclude references only when requested by an employer .\n2 .\ncarefully consider whom to provide after discussion with the prospective employer .\nthe time to check references is before an offer is made , but after the candidate is either the final candidate or among the final few for the job .\n3 .\nseek references from people who actually know you and your work .\nask for permission to list them as a reference .\n4 .\nask directly if they can provide you with a positive reference for the position ( s ) you are seeking .\nif they hesitate , move on !\n5 .\nprepare your references about who will be calling them and what to focus on when talking about you .\nalways ask them to call you after they have been called .\n6

)\n.\n8 .\nlet your references know what happens to you and the position ( s ) you applied for .\nthank your references .\n9 .\nprepare a linkedin site to demonstrate your skills and interests .\n10

{"document": "editor 's note : peter bergen is cnn 's national security analyst , the author of \" manhunt : the ten-year search for bin laden -- from 9/11 to abbottabad \" and a director at the new america foundation .\njennifer rowland is a program associate at the new america foundation .\nwashington ( cnn ) -- we do n't yet know how or why the tsarnaev brothers , the alleged boston marathon bombers , decided to carry out their attacks , but a look at how their stories correlate with those of some other terrorists living in the west could provide some answers to the questions that many are now asking about them .\n1 .\nhow could someone who grew up in the united states , as the younger brother did , become a terrorist ?\nmajor nidal malik hasan , who killed 13 people at fort hood army base in texas in 2009 , was born and raised in virginia .\nhe self-radicalized , in part , over the internet , which he used to reach out to the yemen-based preacher anwar al-awlaki for advice about whether it is permissible for muslim soldiers in the u.s. military to kill their comrades in the name of jihad .\nawlaki , a leader of al qaeda 's affiliate in yemen , was somewhat noncommittal in his responses but did not discourage the act .\ninvestigators will surely be combing through the e-mail traffic of the tsarnaev brothers to see if they either reached out to militant islamist clerics or downloaded lectures by such clerics .\nthey will also examine the brothers ' internet usage to see if they visited jihadist forums or downloaded propaganda from al qaeda or other allied groups .\nand of course , it 's possible their decision to carry out the attacks was reached without any outside influence .\nboston suspects : immigrant dream to american nightmare 2 .\nhow do you square the multiple descriptions of the brothers as \" good guys \" with the fact that they plotted mass murder ?\nit 's worth recalling that mohammed sidique khan , the leader of the suicide attackers who bombed the london transit system in 2005 killing 52 commuters , was a beloved teacher at a primary school in the northern city of leeds who taught children with developmental problems , and the happily married 30-year-old father of a baby daughter .\ncolleagues and acquaintances described khan as a gentle , kind man .\nno surprise then that we are hearing some similar positive characterizations of the brothers tsarnaev .\n3 .\ndid the brothers have any training or practice on explosives ?\nit seems quite unlikely that the perpetrators would have been able to successfully set off two deadly bombs within seconds of each other without some sort of training or practice .\nbomb-making recipes certainly exist on the internet , but actually building effective bombs is generally a skill that requires some training or practice , and even then a successful detonation is not guaranteed .\nbecome a fan of cnnopinion stay up to date on the latest opinion , analysis and conversations through social media .\njoin us at .\nwe welcome your ideas and comments .\nfaizal shahzad , for instance , received bomb-making training from the pakistani taliban before he constructed a bomb in an suv that fizzled out rather than blowing up as he intended in times square on may 1 , 2010 .\nthe older tsarnaev brother , tamerlan , spent six months in russia last year .\nwhat precisely he did there will surely be of intense interest to investigators .\ncould he have received some kind of bomb-training from chechen militants who are experienced in making explosives ?\nnajibullah zazi , a pakistani-american who had also lived for many years in the united states , plotted to blow up bombs on the manhattan subway around the eighth anniversary of 9/11 .\nzazi travelled to pakistan a year before his planned attacks to learn bomb-making techniques from al qaeda militants .\nwas this the kind of model that tamerlan tsarnaev followed ?\nalso , might the tsarnaev brothers have done some kind of test runs of their explosive devices in the united states ?\nopinion : suspects ' culture of migration and machismo 4 .\nif the brothers ' motivation had something to do with their chechen heritage , how might that have played out in this case ?\nin the years after 9/11 , dozens of young somali-american men traveled to fight in the civil war in somalia .\njust as the tsarnaev brothers , these somali-americans were first-generation americans .\nfor these new americans , the politics of their homeland can sometimes become more meaningful and important than it was for their parents who fled the chaos of their native countries for the safety of the united states , and who now want to put those conflicts behind them .\nwhat exactly prompted the fbi to interview tamerlan tsarnaev in 2011 , following a tip from russia that he was \" a follower of radical islam \" and was contemplating leaving the united states to join a clandestine organization ?\n5 .\ndid fbi officials make a mistake when they questioned tamerlan , but did n't seem to further monitor him ?\nmaybe .\nthis is reminiscent of the case of major hasan whose emails to fellow militants came to the attention of the feds before he killed his fellow soldiers at ft. hood , but were not followed up on .\ncarlos bledsoe , a convert to islam , shot up a military recruiting office little rock , arkansas , killing a soldier in 2009 .\nbledsoe was also on the radar of the feds before he travelled to yemen .\nit was only after this trip to yemen , where he linked up with an al qaeda affiliate , that bledsoe carried out the shooting at the recruiting office .\n6 .\ndid the brothers intend to die during the attacks or their aftermath ?\nit seems shocking to many that the tsarnaev brothers might have been wearing suicide vests during their gun battle with police on thursday night , but in reality several u.s. citizens and residents have intended to die in terrorist attacks .\nthree of the young somali-american men who traveled from minnesota to fight in civil war in somalia later carried out suicide attacks there .\nmajor hasan undoubtedly went into his attack on a military base full of armed u.s. soldiers believing that it would be the last thing he did before he died .\n( that prediction did not come true .\nhe was wounded in the attack but not killed ) .\nthe al qaeda recruit zazi , who plotted to bomb the manhattan subway in the summer of 2009 , planned to die in this attack but was arrested before he could pull it off .\nanalysis : older suspect grew increasingly religious 7 .\nwere the brothers really \" lone wolves \" ?\ngiven all the mayhem the two brothers are allegedly responsible for -- two bombings that caused three deaths and some two hundred injuries at the boston marathon as well as the subsequent murder of a policeman at mit -- did they have some kind of additional help ?\naccording to boston law enforcement officials , there is no evidence of such help and it 's worth recalling that hasan was entirely a lone wolf who nonetheless managed to kill 13 on a u.s. military base with heavy security .\n8 .\ndid the older tsarnaev radicalize his younger brother ?\nperhaps .\nwhere there is some kind of terrorist cell there is sometimes a leader who instigates action .\nwe saw this in the case in lackawanna , new york where a group of yemeni-american men who trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 9/11 were radicalized by kamal derwish , a yemeni american who had spent many years living in saudi arabia .\nderwish encouraged his fellow yemeni-americans to travel to afghanistan for military training .\n9 .\nhow unusual is it for brothers to carry out terrorist attacks together ?\nmore frequent than you might think .\nthe deadliest terrorist attack in u.s. history on 9/11 involved three pairs of brothers among the 19 hijackers : brothers waleed and wail al-sheri , hamza and ahmed al-ghamdi and nawaf and salem al-hazmi .", "summary": "peter bergen says the experience of other terrorists living in the west could shed light on the motives and actions of the tsarnaev brothers"}

but \" soul train \" was the first nationwide black-oriented music-variety tv show .\nit was also one of the most successful tv programs ever : to this day , its 35 years in syndication are a record . \"\nif you 're an african-american of a certain age , ' soul train ' was as important to your weekend mornings as your milk was to your cereal , \" broadcasting personality tom joyner wrote in 2010

{"document": "( cnn ) -- two body parts .\none scientific leap .\nscientists in the united states , mexico and switzerland grew reproductive organs and nasal cartilage in labs , and successfully implanted them in patients , according to two studies released in the lancet on thursday .\nit is not the first time scientists have engineered body parts -- in effect , creating organs where before there were none .\nwhat is different in these cases is the size and complexity of the organs . \"\nthis is a move forward to even more challenging ( organs ) , \" said ivan martin , a professor of tissue engineering at university hospital basel in switzerland , and co-author of the nasal cartilage study . \"\nall these incremental steps finally have demonstrated that it is possible to engineer tissue that can help patients . \"\ntissue engineering has focused primarily on repair : burned skin , muscle shorn off during in an accident , a dysfunctional bladder .\nrecent advances go beyond repair to replacement .\none of the two new studies involves a group of four teenage patients born with a rare condition called mayer-rokitansky-küster-hauser syndrome .\nthe patients had either a missing or deformed uterus , an absent or ill-formed vagina , or some other dysfunction .\nthe process for recreating their reproductive systems sounds deceptively simple .\nit begins with scientists creating a 3-d scaffold that mirrors the dimensions of the patients ' missing organs .\nthey then take small swatches of muscle and tissue from the patients , and extract cells .\nthis is not like a defective organ that you augment .\nwe had to create the organ.\ndr .\nanthony atala those cells are then used to \" seed \" ( or spread across ) various surfaces of the 3-d scaffolds , where they grow for a few weeks outside the body . \"\nthis is not like a defective organ that you augment or something you put in between two places , \" said dr. anthony atala , director of the wake forest institute for regenerative medicine and lead author of the vaginal organ study . \"\nwe had to create the organ .\nwe put it in de novo ( anew ) . \"\norgan scaffolds serve multiple purposes : they provide a framework upon which the new organ can grow .\nthey also are made using a material that , over time , melts into the body .\nthe scaffold is slowly absorbed while seeded cells continue to grow .\nit is a delicate and complicated dance that -- when properly performed -- results in a fully functioning organ . \"\nthe body recognizes the organ as its own , \" said atala , chairman of the department of urology at wake forest university . \"\nand just like with normal organs , these organs also grow with ( the patients ) . \"\nnormal , for patients in atala 's study , means structurally intact , functional reproductive organs .\nthe four patients in the study completed surveys indicating normal levels of desire , arousal , lubrication , orgasm , satisfaction and painless intercourse .\nfor two patients , with the new organs came menstruation , which means ovulation and the possibility of reproduction .\njust as important as a structurally intact new organ is the use of autologous ( meaning from the same organism ) cells to engineer tissue .\nautologous cells keep the body from treating the organs as foreigners , an issue of serious concern when it comes to organ donation .\nthere 's a great need for readily available tissue to replace or repair diseased and damaged body parts , according to an editorial about the studies , also published in the lancet . \"\nthe rapidly developing field of tissue engineering might offer innovating solutions , \" the editorial authors write .\nanother clinical need is creating viable cartilage , arguably one of the more difficult tissues to get right in a lab environment .\nscientists used nasal cartilage cells to rebuild the nostrils of five individuals whose noses were damaged by skin cancer .\nin the second lancet study , five elderly patients had substantial chunks of nasal tissue removed after cancer surgery .\nnormally , surgeons would use cartilage from the ear , ribs or the septum to reconstruct the area -- an inherently painful process .\ninstead of recruiting from other areas of the body for reconstruction , these scientists carefully excised a piece of tissue , approximately half the size of the tip of a pen , from the patient 's nasal septum and allowed it to multiply .\nmuch like what was done in the vaginal organ study , scientists then seeded septal cells on a scaffold until they formed a thin layer of cartilage .\nthe engineered cartilage was later laid inside the patient 's wound and allowed to grow .\nwhat has scientists involved with this study excited is that patients emerged with their nasal structure , function and aesthetics intact .\nthe scientists also were able to use biopsied tissue that was about 40 times smaller than would be used during conventional reconstruction .\nin both studies , complications among patients were virtually nonexistent , even after years of follow-up .\npilot studies like these are hampered by size : studies involving so few patients are far from conclusive .\nthese results beg for broader confirmation .\nstill , the field is brimming with the hope that a broader patient group will one day benefit from these findings : women whose reproductive systems are damaged because of trauma or cancer ; or patients needing replacement cartilage in the knee or other body parts .\nmartin is particularly excited by the progress .\nabout 20 years ago , he said , the image of an engineered ear swelling from the back of a mouse raised hopes that lab-grown organs would , by now , be commonly used clinically .\nsince then , he said , there have been some hiccups , but recent studies have resurrected that progress . \"\nit was all considered too easy 20 years ago , \" said martin . \"\nbut we made it ; things are happening now .

, as the yankees look to get under the luxury-tax threshold just once , which will save them millions in tax payments by resetting their status .\nsoriano 's decision to opt out of the $ 14 million owed him in 2013 was perhaps the one benefit of the mariano rivera deal , as soriano racked up the saves that gave him the incentive to hit the market .\nthe team could use kuroda and martin back on short-term deals , and might take a shine to ichiro after his late-season surge as a yankee .\nrivera seems unlikely to play anywhere but new york , but it may be a while before we 're sure if he 'll

the yankees are again likely to stay out of the top of the market and focus on the next tier .\nedwin jackson fits for a team that could be missing a lot of starts and has substantial uncertainty about the health of its rotation next year .\njackson takes the ball 32 times a year and delivers average to above-average results .\nmike napoli would serve as a good patch for the catching spot until sanchez is ready , while allowing romine to break in as a part-time player .\n( a.j.\npierzynski could also do this , but might be more expensive off his career year . )\njoakim soria would be a low-cost bullpen play ; when healthy , he 'd been one of the best closers in the game through 2010 , then had an off year followed by tommy john surgery in ' 12 .\nbottom line : set aside what happened in october .\nthe yankees remain an aging team with a bloated payroll and an inflexible roster .\nthere 's not going to be much in the way of trade options .\nnew york 's focus has to be

now will only complicate things when that youth is ready .\n2012 record : 93-69 , second in al east , lost in division series pending free agents : jim thome , joe saunders , ronny paulino the orioles ' roster largely consists of young veterans who are either short of free agency or signed to medium-term contacts .\nfor a team desperately short of obp , bringing thome back would not be a bad idea ,

stuff that projects well in a full season of al east baseball .\n.\n.\ntop prospect on the verge : dylan bundy , rhp .\n.\n.\nand besides , the orioles need to make room for the best prospect in baseball .\nbundy started the year making three-inning starts in the sally league and ended it in the orioles ' bullpen .\njust 20 when next season begins , it 's unlikely that he will be in the baltimore 's rotation in april , or throw more than 150 innings at all levels combined .\nhe is , however , a fantastic combination of power and polish who should be a fixture on their staff for years to come .\ntargets : starting pitching , outfield , third base the orioles are actually a great fit for zack greinke .\nthey have the payroll room for him , with just $ 53 million in 2013 commitments plus a handful of expected arbitration raises .\nonly adam jones has a deal beyond 2014 , so this is n't the dodgers owing a hundred million bucks a year until the rapture .\nwhile baltimore 's second-half rotation was stronger than what it had in the first half , it remains a collection of back-rotation starters .\ngreinke would front it while allowing bundy to develop without the pressure of the team needing a front-line starter .\nif the orioles ca n't land greinke -- who , given the market , could get up to cole hamels ' six-year , $ 144 million contract -- they should stay out of the secondary pitching market and instead look to improve a team obp that hindered the offense last season .\nwith the caveat that price and deal length matter , they could use nick swisher in leftfield , kevin youkilis at third base ( with manny machado , somewhat overmatched , starting the year at triple-a ) or perhaps marco scutaro at second base .\nbottom line : the orioles have to not buy into the hype .\nthey were n't a 93-win team , but rather , a .500 team that got a bit lucky .\ntheir focus has to be not on 2013 , when they 're likely to regress back below par , but on 2014 and

b.j.\nupton , carlos pena , jeff keppinger , joel peralta the rays are set to lose a significant chunk of the production from a mediocre offense , and they lack good internal options to make it better in the short term .\nif they lose all three of their free-agent hitters , they 'll be left with evan longoria , matt joyce and a lot of question marks heading into 2012 .\ntrading pitching for hitting is almost inevitable , as a lack of run scoring is what kept tampa bay out of the 2012 postseason .\ntop prospect on the verge : hak-ju lee , ss lee , acquired from the cubs in the matt garza trade , has pushed aside former no.\n1 overall pick tim beckham to become the shortstop of the rays ' future -- possibly as soon as opening day .\nhe 's a slap hitter with a reasonable approach , but his strikeout totals ( 102 last year in 475 ab ) are high for a player with his lack of power .\nmichael bourn has shown that you can succeed this way , but there 's risk in the profile .\nlee is a plus

their mother paid the fine . \"\nsometimes i wonder where their brains are at , \" tillotson 's mother , lori lee , said of her children . \"\nthey do such impulsive things , and sometimes i just do n't think they 're thinking . \"\nneuroscientists confirm that teenagers do have brains , but they 're wired differently from those of adults .\nwhy many teenagers seek thrills , break rules and seem nonchalant about their own safety has been a question brain scientists have worked to answer in the last two decades .\ntop researchers use functional magnetic resonance imaging to see this brain activity .\na new study in the journal nature found that structural changes in adolescents ' brains correspond to fluctuations in iq over time , with some young people improving and some falling back on these tests .\nteens improve at such tests at different rates , and it 's difficult to know how someone will do a few years after the initial assessment , said study co-author cathy price at the wellcome trust center for neuroimaging .\nit 's not yet clear whether fluctuations seen in this study are unique to this age group , or whether they would be similar across a lifespan .\nscientists typically refer to \" the teenage brain \" in 13 - to 17-year-olds , but that does n't mean that college students are totally \" adults \" yet .\nin fact , research from the national institutes of health has shown , the prefrontal cortex , a region of the brain associated with inhibition of risky behavior , does n't get fully developed until age 25 .\nthe connections between the prefrontal cortex and other areas of the brain are also developing in teenagers .\nand a number of deep structures in the brain are influenced by changes in hormones , which may lead to heightened emotions .\nthe way that brain regions talk to one another in teenagers may explain teens ' sometimes confounding behavior , scientists say .\neven in their mid-teens , adolescents can make quick , efficient , correct decisions ; in the heat of the moment , though , the brain 's deep emotional centers will win out over reason . \"\nit 's not like these brain parts are n't there .\nit 's how they get wired and become fine-tuned with experiences , \" said bj casey , director of the sackler institute at weill medical college of cornell university .\nthey get what they want teens are more sensitive than adults to rewards of situations or activities , and less sensitive to risks , brain imaging research shows .\nlaurence steinberg , a professor of psychology at temple university and author of \" you and your adolescent : the essential guide for ages 10 to 25 , \" has done research in this area .\nhe found that when teenagers are in the presence of friends , the reward system gets aroused even more . \"\nit 's not that adolescents do n't understand risk .\nthey understand it perfectly well , \" says beatriz luna , a neuroscientist at the university of pittsburgh . \"\nit 's just that they find it more rewarding to impress their peers , and things of that sort , than the risk that 's involved to their actual survival ; it 's just what they value at that point . \"\nthis would help explain why teens give in to peer pressure more easily than adults -- for instance , in breaking the law to jump into a pool in the middle of the night , as tillotson did . \"\ni 'm not someone who makes big mistakes like that .\ni 'm usually the goody-goody in my family , \" says tillotson , 19 , of rural north carolina .\nher 15-year-old sister , tessa , is the family 's rebel , their mother says .\nit 's not unusual for tessa to sneak out behind her mother 's back and go to the park . \"\ni do n't like my mom to say no , \" tessa says .\nthere 's an evolutionary explanation for this kind of behavior : in most mammals , adolescence is the time when individuals leave the family environment , steinberg said .\nsensation-seeking leads pubescent creatures to go find sexual partners and a social structure outside the home .\nthey need to become independent of their parents and adapt to new surroundings .\nventuring out into the wild and leaving the security of parents is a risky thing to do , so there must be some built-in biological mechanism to ignore the potential dangers of the wild , scientists reason . \"\nif it did n't happen , we would n't leave home and reproduce , \" steinberg explains .\nand what they want can be dangerous the reward-seeking brains of teens may lead them to experiment with pleasure-inducing substances like drugs and alcohol , which are especially dangerous for this age group , scientists say .\nsince vital structures in the teen brain are still developing , adolescents are more prone to brain damage from drugs and alcohol .\nresearch has shown that teenagers who binge drink will have greater brain damage than adults .\nand teens are more vulnerable to stress , which may lead to an increased risk of depression later in life .\nmarijuana can stay in a teenager 's system for days , impacting the building blocks of learning and memory .\nthat 's because the teen brain probably has more receptors drugs to bind to -- the same is true for alcohol .\nand in teens who regularly use pot , iq can permanently decrease , research has shown .\non the plus side , teens are rapid learners , since their brains are still developing .\nbut that also means they can get \" addicted faster , longer and stronger , \" dr. frances jensen said at tedmed in 2010 .\nthat 's because addiction is related to learning and memory ; teens may be able to pick up a language faster than an adult , but they can also develop dangerous habits more easily , too .\nso what 's a parent to do ?\nsteinberg says it 's a lot harder to change the reward-seeking predilections of teenagers than to restructure the environment in a safer way .\nparents can make sure kids do n't spend a lot of time unsupervised .\nfor instance , they can enroll teens in healthy after-school programs where adults are present .\non a societal level , raising the price of substances such as alcohol and cigarettes would curb teens ' use of them .\nthis would produce a greater change in behavior among young people than education programs , research has shown .\nthat 's not to say that kids ca n't learn from their mistakes .\nthere 's a broad spectrum of sensation-seeking and tolerance for risk among this age group , so some teens wo n't get into as much trouble as others .\nand even though they may be saying \" get out of my face \" when you offer advice , they may be listening and need your support , says luna , the university of pittsburgh neuroscientist .\nand behavior is n't entirely determined by biology , either .\nparents can also help by rewarding good behavior instead of emphasizing punishment of negative behavior , steinberg said .\nfind an incentive that gets your child motivated -- for example , give a bonus in allowance when he or she does something good rather than taking away money as a penalty .\nas for tillotson , after the pool incident , she had to do 40 hours of community service for the chief of police , and she was on probation for six months .\nher mother made tillotson and her brother , who is older and does n't live at home , earn money to reimburse her for the fines she paid for them ; tillotson is halfway there . \"\ni think that 's one of the best decisions parents can do for their children : make them accountable for their actions , \" said her mother , lori lee .\na phase that ends with responsibility as young people move past the teen years and gain more responsibility , they tend to be less inclined toward risk-taking , luna said .\ntillotson felt guilty about the pool situation , but since then , she 's re-earned her mother 's trust .\nand she 's making adult choices : going to college , working as a restaurant hostess and postponing her beauty pageant participation to focus on her studies .\nshe tries to encourage her sister tessa , who 's been getting into her own share of trouble at home , to think before she acts . \"\nall teenagers act on their impulse just out of instinct , \" tillotson said . \"\nit 's like ripping off a bandage ;

constitution is outdated and outmoded in todays world and each amendment should be revised to apply to todays world , not something that was written two hundred years ago that may have applied to the world at that time .\neach amendment should be looked at and changed if necessary .\ntypes of guns then , and types of guns today , immigration laws then and how it would apply to today .\nit 's badly outdated and should be changed .\nsen. santorum made the best argument for sensitivity : what if a church that preached \" racial separation and that mlk 's death was his fault \" wanted to build a church at the site mlk was murdered ?\nwould it be legal and constitutional ?\nyes .\nwould it be insensitive , painful and in bad taste ?\nyes .\nand that is exactly what building a mosque at ground zero feels like .\nit is grossly insensitive , will bring pain to so many and it is just plain wrong .\ni am astounded that our president and other leaders can be so insensitive .\nyes , building this mosque so close to ground zero is in bad taste .\nbut ... the new york city authorities have all signed off on this , and more importantly , people get to choose where they can worship in this country ( unless it is an imminent public hazard ... for example you can not hold a religious service in th middle of an interstate highway ) .\nto say differently means you are for the sort of restrictions against christian and jewish worship that are common in arab countries .\ni thought we were better than those countries , right wingers ?\nand to those who say this mosque might well be an \" imminent public hazard \" as it will harbor terrorists ... you could be right .\nbut i agree with john : let 'em have their mosque but keep it in under constant , and complete , surveillance .\n( and not just by the cia and fbi ... i would hope the far-right would do more than complain on the internet about the mosque and , organize massive pickets in front of it .\ni 'm talking 24/7/365 protesting .\nor are you all too fat and rich to do that sort of thing ? )\nreply to ad .\nand what do you call the inman in charge of this project ?\nas far as i 'm concerned he should be sitting in gitmo , not erecting a mosque by ground zero .\nand by the way the aryan nations do have a church , it 's called the church of jesus christ christian .\nthe aryan nations sprang from this church .\nthey seem to have the same views as muslims concerning people of the jewish faith .\nso where is the hate really ?\nwhy has no one mentioned that if the mosque is built the city will no longer get any property tax from that land ?\nand just how much tax money per year is being given up .\nso in effect , the city of new york will be subsidizing this mosque with the loss of public money .\nkings logic = any violence done in the name of a relgion should mean the religion is to blame .\ni guess he hates christians a real lot .\nking 's logic is flawed and designed to appeal to his constituent 's fear and paranoia .\nit 's a cynical and destructive way to get votes .\nmany crimes are carried out \" in the name \" of one thing or another , but that does n't make the connection legitimate .\nin fact , al qaeda membership represents less than 1 % of the total number of muslims on the planet .\nfurthermore , by allowing the islamic center to be built , it demonstrates that islam is not the enemy of the united states , therefore young muslims will have one less reason to join al qaeda and other anti-west sects .\naside from being consistent with our own constitution , it is intelligent strategy to embrace moderate muslims whenever we can .\nthere is no rational reason for not the allowing the construction of this center .\nhow about they reopen the investigation on 911 so that all americans can see that it was executed with the assistance of the cia all so they could get soldiers in afghanistan to try to reclaim their hold on the drug trade there .\nalqeada had declared war on the cia becuase they got tired of giving the cia money after they were created to run the cia drug business there .\nthe cia was unable to assasinate alqeada so they needed us army to help .\nthis is why the trade center was targeted its the cia hq .\nnow note alqeada did attack us , but the cia assisted them ot make sure the outcome was catastrophic , anything less would not lead to war .\nwhat union contractor or workers are going to build it ?\nenjoy your victory mosque !!\nand the hundreds more being built all over the usa .\ni thought that the president was very clear with his original remarks , and with his follow up comments , which were entirely consistent with each other .\nnowhere did he \" support \" the building of a mosque near ground zero – he supported the right to build it .\nbuilding a mosque close to ground zero may be unwise , but there seems to be a sentiment that it should also be unlawful .\nthe president was simply making it clear that making it unlawful would would be fundamentally against your constitution .\nyep thats a trade in tollerance – let the muslims build there mosque - right on ground zero that they show how tollerant of tother trreligions they are by allowing the hebrew temple to be built on the temple mount by the dome of the rock : } : } : } ....... .\nyou know i never heard of young boys getting molested at a muslem church and you do n't hear about little girls being raped by muslem preachers .\ni do hear these atrocities from the christian church .\nand the christians will tell you that your going to hell unless you only believe in their god .\nwe can also go back to the salem witch trials and the crusades and it makes what the muslems do seem like childs play .\nin the end you will all see that there is one god and weather you choose to call him mohamed or jesus you will reap what you have sewn with your fellow human being .\nhi ho hiho off to work we go .\n.\nseems stressful times calls on us to grow .\n.\n.\ngreat news .\n.\nok so now lets blame the kkk for all the wrongs in done in the name of christ .\nrelax an unfold america it 's known without a doubt that most muslims are peace loving people tolerant of other people and their religions .\nthat is why it is clear that the people behind wanting to build this mosque fall into a minority group of muslims that are not peace loving and tolerant .\nif these particular muslims were acting in the spirit of peace , love and tolerance they would build this mosque further away from ground zero where the majority of america would not take offense to it .\ntherefore , the only reason the people building this mosque insist on their legal right to do so is because they are acting in anger , hate and intolerance .\nthey know it serves as shrine to the radical muslim terrorist who brought down the twin towers and at heart because they see these people as heroes and the shrine to their gods soldiers must be built .\nwhat he does n't seem to understand when he thinks these attacks were \" carried out in the name of islam \" is that this does not encompass the whole religion .\nthere are tons of christians as well who hide their political beliefs and discrimination by saying it 's carried out in the name of christianity .\nthis is n't about religion so much as it is about politics .\n9/11 happened because of politics , not religion .\nit was a political agenda that was shown .\nreligion itself is very peaceful .\npeople who skew religion to justify their political beliefs are not real religious people .\nchristianity and islam are both very peaceful religions .\nwe can not look at one instance and say that this is what muslims do .\nneither can we say that just because a bunch of priests molested children , that this is what christianity is about either .\nthe religions are not about these things .\nit 's really pathetic and disappointing that people in this country are so blinded by their ignorance .\nthe fact is that obama and all the people , including myself , that support the mosque being built are right and those against it are wrong .\nread the constitution .\nlearn the constitution .\nit 's a big part of why people love this country and are so patriotic .\nif you do n't like it then leave this country .\nplain and simple .\nby the way i am a 21 year old third generation lebanese and my family is christian .\nif america allows this mosque to be built by its attackers religion - on sacred ground - islam should show how tollerant it is of other religions and allow the temple of the herews to be rebuilt next to the dome of the rock .\n.\nthat is a true test of tollerance – i bet the islamics will fail : } : } : } if only people went back into the history of christianity there would see a war matched that went on for centuries , forced conversions , burning at stakes and what not .\n.\n.\nwhy not just leave religion alone and deal with the groups involved .\njust look at these two guys faces on the picture in the article ... so filled with hatred and hard anger .... that 's not preached in any faith and even any faith may preach violence and hatred , where is our logic and humanity gone ?\ni 've got it !\nlet 's build a memorial to all those lost japanese souls lost in pear harbor .\nafter all not all the japanese fought us .\n.\nthis country sucks .\nit stands for nothing .\n.\nall wars/acts of terrorism are based in some form of religion !\nking is wrong .\nit may be in bad taste , and many may feel offended , but that 's no reason to overrule the constitution .\ntoday the 1st amendment protects an unpopular minority .\ntomorrow it may protect you .\nwhat i want to know is why has n't something appropriate been built on ground zero by now ?\ni believe it is gods intention for all religions to come together to know that he is god .\nstop the religious hypocrisy in this country .\nwhen will christians start acting like jesus tells us to act ?\noh yes , when we are demanding that others stop worshiping wealth and using violence to get what they want .\ncrtitics of the president 's support for the islamic center would be equally outraged , and more justifiably , if he said he opposed it .\nfor opposing and trying to stop the center would mean that the president is actually doing something of which his critics constantly and falsely accuse him : violating the constitution , in particular , its protection of the freedom of religion .\neither this is a nation of laws or it is not .\nif it is a nation of laws and the law allows for the center to be built ( and it does ) , then to refuse to allow its construction violates the foundation of this nation .\nwe may not like it , but we must support it .\nthis should n't even be a question .\nof course the cordoba center should be built – not only is it their constitutional right , but there is a muslim community in manhattan who are as american as anybody else .\nthis whole issue is being used as propaganda by bigoted knuckleheads .\ntax all churches , and other religious institutions , so that they may \" render unto caesar that which is caesar 's \" .\na leader would have strong command of his words both before and after his polls drop .\nthis guys a a lawyer playing it safe .\nabsolutely not a leader .\nobviously a mosque has a legal right to build in a sensitive area , but doing so would defy popular sentiment so much that it would insight violence in wake of it being perceived by many americans as a slap in the face .\nislam may not be militant but a ton of islamists are still living in the middle ages and seek to wage holy wars .\nthis can not be a good decision nor should a leader be so unclear with his message .\nthis is not my president .\nabsolutely if a mosque pops up , i support a gay bar popping up right next door .\nafter all , they have a legal right to be located next to a mosque as well .\njj - a lot of ' sensitivity ' gets disguised as ' evil ' too .\n.\nwhat you you say we go build a cathedral in mecca , that would go over like a fart in church !\n... i am still waiting for the islamic outrage and public relations spin from the 911 .\neither our main stream media is n't reporting it or it is n't there , i 'm opting for the latter and the mosque is just another show of the viral infection headed our way .\nthe topic of taxing churches is a good one , and should be talked about much more .\nwhy should they be exempt , when obviously they are a business just like any other .\ni worked for two churches , one baptist and the other lutheran , and in both cases , the bottom line was always the bottom line .\nmoney talks and jesus saves ..... at first national bank .\ntaxes churches of all faiths equally would be a good way to get the country out of debt .\nwhy should they get a free ride while everyone else pays .\nmaybe the constitution needs a complete update and be rewritten since everyone wants it to do what they want it too .\nfor those who support the constitution – the law allows the mosque to be built .\ntherefore , elected officials have no constitutional authority to stop it .\nwe may be opposed to it morally .\nwe may think it is insensitive .\nwe have the right to object , to try to convince , to be angry .\nbut , if we support the constitution , we must accept that we have no right to prevent the mosque from being built .\nthe constitution provides for protection from the ' tyranny of the masses ' , and the whims of government .\nif you think elected officials * should * intervene , and you vote based upon that – then you are * not * in support of the constitution .\ninstead , you are in support of tyranny – because you are in support of putting officials in place who would oppress any group that the majority do n't like .\nthat * is * the definition of tyranny and oppression .\ni find it distressing that so many who call themselves american can not see this .\npeople will believe only what they want to believe .\nif you are saying there are no christian terrorists in 2010 , then you are wrong my friend .\nopen your eyes up .\nread up about christian atrocities in north east india and africa .\nplease do not compare america to third world islamic nations .\nif you really want to compare , then please compare 3rd world islamic nations with 3rd world christian nations .\nnadler is right al-queda attacked us , not the entire muslim world !!\nwhere is osama bin laden ?\nstill ca n't find him hmmmm ?\nwhy is n't the new wtc construction taking soooo long , will the mosque be completed first probably sooo !!\nny city corruption !!\nwake up !\neveryone seems to overlook the fact the of the 3000 + innocent people who lost their lives that day it also included a number of muslim americans .\nthose victim 's families suffered just as much loss and grief as any other .\nbut because they are muslims they somehow do n't count .\nblaming all of islam for the actions of misguided extremists who commit atrocities in the name of islam .\nover the years , there have been many delusional , misguided people who have , of their own accord , commited various atrocities in the name of christianity ( i am not talking about the atrocities commited by the church itself ) – does this mean that their actions were condoned by the church itself ?\ndoes it mean every christian in the world supports these atrocities ?\nof course not .\nanyone can stand up and say \" i do this in the name of my religion \" – it does not mean their religion would supports it .\nthe non-moslem supporters of this mosque make the fundamental error of considering islam to be a religion just like other religions .\nin fact , islam is far more than a religion .\nit is also an ideology - supremacist , bigoted , aggressive , totalitarian and imperialist .\nyusuf qaradawi ( the most influential muslim cleric in the world today , the spiritual head of the muslim brotherhood ) says : \" islam is not a religion in the common , distorted meaning of the word , confining its scope only to the private life of man .\nby saying that it is a complete way of life , we mean that it caters for all the fields of human existence .\nin fact , islam provides guidance for all walks of life — individual and social , material and moral , economic and political , legal and cultural , national and international . \"\nqaradawi is talking about sharia law which all moslems are supposed to follow .\nsharia law , among other nasty things , requires the legal subordination of non-moslems and women ; it requires the death penalty for apostasy , blasphemy , homosexuality and a host of other sin/crimes .\nthe most popular manual of sharia law , umdat al salik , approved by the highest islamic authorities of syria , jordan , saudi arabia and egpyt defines jihad this way : \" jihad means to make war on non-muslims . \"\nwhat could be plainer than that ?\nislam is not a religion like other religions .\nthis islamic center will become a shrine that is visited by muslims from all over the world to celebrate the killing of 3000 innocent people .\nthe palestinians partied in the streets when the buildings came down ... how stupid is the leadership of this country ?\ni am sick of all of this .\ni am very proud of the leadership that kept an even focus during all of this histrionic debating .\nthe misinformation on this issue has been startling .\npeople can pray where they see fit and government plays no role in that .\nwhat is being said about muslims is same as people used to say about germans , and before the the irish and the jews .\nthere is always a boogie man in the form of a cultural group coming to get everyone .\ni wonder how many folks with abbreviated german surnames that were shortened during wwi or wwii to hide their heritage from being labeled the enemy are now leading the charge on this issue .\nand around and around we go .\nwe are not as original as we think we are .\no , and for all the folks trying to draw parallels to pearl harbor , there is a japanese cultural center less than a mile from pearl harbor .\nit 's called the japanese cultural center of hawaii .\nlook it up .\ni reallywish people would do their homework before repeating one liners over and over again .\n@steve .\n.\njust as you have the common sense to differentiate between aryan nations and the church , you should have the brains to differentiate between the terrorists and the mosque .\nthis is not a mosque for the terrorists .\ni am sure there are a lot of churches around the place where martin luther king was martyred , apart from the church at the national civil rights museum .\nblind hatred will get us nowhere .\ntwo questions that no one is asking .\nwhere did all of money for this islamic center come from and why now ?\nwhy are the muslims calling this the cordoba initiative ?\nis it just a coincidence that cordoba was the first place muslims built a mosque on the site of a cathedral that they demolished shortly after their conquest of parts of spain ?\nany defense of this project before convincing answers to these questions are offered is evidence of stupidity not open mindedness .\nlet them have it .\nwe will have cameras rolling throughout the building .\ncia should be handling the security of the building .\nevery single person that enters or visits this mosque should be entered into systems and checked against the no-fly list and international warrants .\nuse it like bait .\nboth have good arguments : wow that is refreshing to say and well , no shortage of strong opioniated posts here i understand both representative 's points , i do not think an islam center should go so near 9/11 sight islam is important is very underrepresented both interms of their national voice and physical presence .\ndo i want to hear the call to prayer through out a city like i do in turkey or london , frankly no .\nbut i understand it is like the church bells on sunday ... and in its own way it is pretty , but no i do n't .\nand definately not 5 times a day there is nothing wrong with clarifying the 14th amendment towards citizenship .\nthis was not an original law made by the founding fathers .\ni see no problem to this considering it was made back then in 1868 from the will of the people , and now the will of the people in present day want to be more specific about it .\nwe lose 50 billion + to illegals every year , and we have lost over 21,000 american lives to illegal immigrants .\nplease tell the families of those victims that you have no problem with the clarification , and that you intend to pay their share of the 50 billion . \"\nas a christian , i am amazed that there is so much uproar and so much amnesia regarding this issue .\neveryone wants the legacy of our forefathers to match their beliefs .\nif it were suggested that the 2nd amendment be modified to outlaw guns many would go crazy .... but it 's ok to change the 14th amendment to ban some from becoming citizens . \"\nwhat if , for hypothesis sake , the land on which the two world trade towers stood was a private land and acquired by an islamic group to build a huge community centre which included a mosque .\nwhat would be the reaction then ??!!\nhaha .\nas a paid up member , i apologise for these right wingnuts .\ngod help us if they ever see power .\npeter , peter , the little teabag eater.\nthis clown should just stfu .\nwe are all at fault ... it should be brilliantly crystal clear to all of us that democrats

to the rest of the world .\nvote & vote & vote some more , until we clear the entire two party congress and administration out .\nthat would provide real hope & change !\nresponse to will : what i think it 's terribly troubling is that when we finally go to war with the iranians , the american people will have to question what side of the fence their commander in chief is truly on .\nto april and brenda t : well chris , unfortunately for your poorly thought of comment , this is 2010 now here in the u.s. and the rest of the civilized world .\nthere are no christian crusades , and christianity follows the 10 commandments .\nthey are not true christians if they kill .\nyou ca n't say the same for islam , which if you knew anything about , you 'd know that it was started from a sadistic , mass-murdering , pedophile & thief that says it 's okay to kill infidels in the name of allah .\np.s.\nit 's spelled \" inquisition \" and \" native \" chris \" king said \" the attacks were carried out in the name of islam . \"\nin the name of christ abortion doctors have been murdered , the inquistion has tortured and burnt at the stake countless innocents , and natvie people have

making a big mistake ... .\nright or wrong to build it , who knows ... this place will become a national place of protest .\n.\nviolence will become the answer ... bad move by obamba to support this and bring the national debate to him ... .\nall these people who say that its just about the mosque 's location near ground zero and that it has nothing to do with bigotry is a load of horse hockey !\njust read the virulent , hate filled rants against muslims made in some of these comments .\nits obvious that these people have nothing but loathing and contempt for all muslims everywhere .\nall over the country , mosques are being targeted , none of which are even close to ground zero .\nto insist that bigotry is n't playing a big role in the protest of nyc mosque is to be burying your head in the sand .\nwhy do the republicans hate the constitution so much ?\nis it really just a piece of paper to you ?\ni used to live in peter king 's district .\nany nine term congressman like him is nothing more than a money launderer .\nhe takes money that was seized by washington and distributes it to people and businesses that supported him financially .\nsort of the same as the taliban and the opium trade .\nso who is he to comment .\nthis money launderer had the same ugly comments when michael jackson died .\nthe truth is obama is right , the freedom to practice or not practice religion is guaranteed by the constitution .\nbut i do question the wisdom and sensitivity of building it down there .\nchristianity is about love and peace .\njesus did n't preach war but brought peace even by his own death .\nchristianity expanded from jerusalem to the ends of the world by preaching love and peace .\ntrue christians were persecuted and suffered as jesus did .\nofcourse there are many who did wrong in the name of chrisitianity .\nislam on the other had is about war and submission from the biggining .\nnorth africa ( egypt , lybia , algeria .\n. )\nwere forced to become muslims by the sword ... so i do n't see the comparison between the two beliefs the great mosque of cordoba placed its importance amongst the islamic community of al-andalus for three centuries .\nin cordoba , the capital of al-andalus , the great mosque was seen as the heart and central focus of the capital i am muslim and i do support the mosque 3 blocks a way from ground zero just as i dont have any problem with churches all over iraq after millions dies because of oil .\nthink positive , you might find a better day forward .\nwhy not just put a japaneese memorial in pearl harbor too ?\nhistory shows , those who win the wars get to write the history books ... if i say the mosque is in poor taste .... how is that bigoted or a racist statement ?\nhow is that spewing hate ??\nits an opinion ... nothing else .... so why do you liberals believe everyone who does n't agree with you is somehow a backwoods racist/bigot/small minded person .\nfor a ' party of tolerance ' you democrats are anything but ... any resistance to the building of this islamic center can only be based on an awareness of the threat posed by islam to western values and life styles as demonstrated by the behavior of muslim immigrants in their host nations all accross europe .\ndear larry , you say resistance to the project can only be based on ignorance and racism ?\nwhy ca n't it be based on something like , oh , say , crippling grief , agonizing emotional trauma , righteous indignation , or just plain ol' american patriotism ?\nyou are the one who is ignorant .\nobama did n't \" declare his support \" .\nhe merely asserted that they have a right to build it ; whether they should is an entirely different matter .\nthe muslim center is on land bought by them and not on holy ground .\ni did n't think and do n't think there is such a thing in the first place .\ninteresting how the right talks about religious freedom and the wants to ignore it here !\ndisgusting and hypocritical as well as being against the constitution !\nthe us constitution supports it , and the only rebuttal seems to be fear of islam .\ni question the opening on the 10th anniversary of the attack , but recognize that it is far more important to uphold the us constitution and not cave in to the emotions of victim 's families .\nok then why not let the aryan nations build a church at the site where martin luther king was killed or erect a shinto shrine for emperor hirohito at pearl harbor ?\nthis whole situation is nuts !\non top of the insenitivity being displayed by the muslims in this situation , take at inman farouk abdul rauf who is in charge of the project .\nhe has been linked to terrorist groups outside the us and he refuses to label hamas as a terrorist organization .\nhe has also blamed america as responsible in part for the 9/11 attack , as well as for the existence of osama bin ladin .\nthis guy is poking us in the eye and obama is standing up for him .\nwhat a farce

{"document": "they are poised for another clash in the third presidential debate , which will be their final chance to change the trajectory of the election as millions of viewers tune in for the last big televised spectacular of a rancorous campaign .\ntrump is under intense pressure to use the debate , just 20 days before election day , as a springboard for a comeback after a slide in the polls that started after clinton 's victory in the first debate and leaves him a heavy underdog .\nclinton will seek to consolidate her strong position , knowing that a winning performance could help close out trump .\nbut she is facing a barrage of new attacks following an avalanche of hacked emails released over the past week from wikileaks .\nshe is bracing for a ferocious counter-attack from a foe who has proven in past debates that there 's no line he wo n't cross .\none of the first questions about the debate will be answered before it even gets under way : will the bitter rivals even shake hands ?\nhours before the the last debate in st. louis 10 days ago , trump appeared with women who had accused former president bill clinton of sexual assault , in a bid to insulate himself against a controversy over his sexually aggressive language revealed on a decade-old \" access hollywood \" video tape .\nhis stunt led to a frosty opening with no exchange of pleasantries between the party nominees .\nin any normal presidential race , the candidate who is behind -- in this case trump -- would show up at the debate and try to mitigate the temperamental vulnerabilities that contributed to the campaign 's slipping poll numbers and show a more presidential demeanor .\nbut trump is no normal candidate , so there is huge uncertainty about how he will approach the final debate after scientific polls show that he lost both previous showdowns with clinton .\nhe faces a clear choice heading into the clash , which will make broadcasting history as moderator chris wallace will be the first fox news anchor ever to preside over an official presidential debate .\ntrump could either return to the combative style he demonstrated during the first two debates , effectively taking his unrestrained performance on the campaign trail into the debate hall .\nor he could seek to present a more sober personality to the american people , offering more specifics on how he would govern and displaying a more even temperament as he seeks to turn the page on recent controversies .\nsince the second presidential debate , trump has faced a string of accusations of sexual assault , all of which he has branded as lies .\nhe also made an accusation that no candidate in modern times has dared to level -- that the election is rigged against him .\nthe gop nominee has repeatedly lashed out at house speaker paul ryan , who he believes is not giving him the support he deserves .\nas a result , trump has declared himself \" unshackled \" and intends to close out his campaign free from an obligation to toe the republican line .\nhe 's said that clinton should be forced to take a drug test before their final debate clash , and doubled down on his vow to put her in jail if he is elected .\naaron kall , editor of a new book that analyzes trump 's primary debate performances , points out that his aggressive showing in the last debate in st. louis -- one of the most acrimonious moments in recent us political history -- came when he was still somewhat restrained . \"\nnow he is unshackled , what does he have to lose ? \"\nkall said , adding that he expected trump to be on offense most of the night .\nthe gop nominee will likely skewer clinton on his claims that hacked emails from her campaign published by wikileaks expose wrongdoing and pay-to-play while she was secretary of state , hammer her over the private email server that has haunted her campaign , and try to position himself as the only candidate who can overthrow a reeking washington establishment , kall said .\nhe is also likely to expand on his accusations that newly released state department documents show a senior official offered a quid-pro-quo in a fight with the fbi over the classification level of an email from her private server in a bid to shield clinton .\nthe department has denied the claim .\nbut trump ca n't afford to replicate his performances in the first two debates , when he was diverted from his most potent attacks on trade and the economy , by traps laid by clinton or her jabs at his personality and business record .\ntrump , down nine points in the latest cnn poll of polls , is almost out of time to launch what would be one of the most remarkable comebacks of modern times . \"\nnothing he does in 90 minutes is going to cause a dramatic impact and all of the polls are going to be tied again , \" said kall , director of debate at the university of michigan . \"\nbut the first step is to have a good debate -- and the media loves a comeback story . \"\ntodd graham , debate director at southern illinois university , said trump also needs to avoid behavior and wild statements in the debates that end up being endlessly repeated and fact checked afterward and lead to damning assessments of his performance . \"\nwhat ails him is he has got too much hyperbole and he has got too many falsehoods in debates , \" graham told cnn 's brooke baldwin on tuesday .\nlike trump , clinton has choices to make .\ndoes the democratic nominee seek to protect her lead with only three weeks to go in the race or will she slug it out with trump in a nasty , personal confrontation , as she did during the first two debates ?\nclinton could try to hover above the fray , portraying herself as a president-elect in waiting , and seek to make the kind of emotional and philosophical connection she has yet to really forge with the american people through decades on the political stage and a grueling campaign that has dragged on for over a year-and-a-half .\nsuch an approach might enable clinton to begin to build political momentum for her transition and early months of her presidency if she wins on november 8 , but could also open her to charges of complacency before she has closed trump out .\nunlike trump , who has been touring the country and holding packed rallies , clinton has been off the campaign trail for days , characteristically preparing for the debate .\nthe republican nominee could not resist one of his now characteristic swipes at the former secretary of state 's habit of huddling with aides to carry out mock debates . \"\ntomorrow night 's going to be interesting .\nnow she 's home sleeping , and i am working .\nso that 's the way it 's going to be in the white house too .\nshe 'd be sleeping , i 'd be working , \" trump said at a rally in colorado on tuesday night .\ntrump did , however , hold some debate prep sessions this time .\nrepublican national committee chair reince priebus asked questions as he portrayed a moderator while new jersey gov.\nchris christie stood in as clinton .\nclinton rebuked trump during the first debate by saying that she not only prepared for debates , she had also prepared to be president .\nand her communications director , jennifer palmieri , said tuesday that the democratic nominee would be ready whichever strategy trump adopts at the final debate . \"\nif he chooses to continue to embrace his strategy of a scorched earth campaign ... she 'll be prepared to handle that as she has the last two times , \" palmieri said . \"\nwhat we have seen is when he does do that , the character of hillary clinton that 's revealed to voters is someone that is quite capable of standing up to him and defending american values . \"\ntrump 's claims that the election is \" rigged \" have offered clinton a new opening to question his character and paint him as a radical departure from any president in modern history .\nclinton may also seize on his use of campaign emails stolen by wikileaks to claim that he is manipulating private information allegedly procured by russian intelligence services to influence the us election .\nshe could point to that to further paint trump as overly friendly with a us foe , russian president vladimir putin .\nsuch charges play into clinton 's wider campaign narrative about trump : that he lacks the temperament and in depth policy knowledge required of a commander in chief -- a characterization that the gop nominee has to some extent helped validate with his volatile debate performances .\nas in previous debates , clinton and trump are playing mind games in advance of their showdown .\nthe gop nominee invited patricia smith , the mother of benghazi victim sean smith , who has accused the former secretary of state of \" murdering \" her son .\nclinton is bringing mark cuban , the billionaire who has feuded with trump , to sit in the audience .\nbut it 's hard to see two such seasoned performers being knocked off their game by

shareholders to meet users ' needs .\nsome 60,000 tweets to the campaign 's #fbrape hashtag made clear that violently misogynistic content was doing damage to facebook 's relationship with its user base .\nfacebook makes thousands of decisions a day about what sort of content is acceptable on its site .\nsoraya chemaly , one of the founders of this month 's campaign along with activist groups women action and the media and everyday sexism , told me that facebook 's moderation of ads or content like breastfeeding photos \" put them in a position of interpreting this content and deciding what would stay up and what would not .\n... it became evident that there was a double standard when it came to gender . \"\nviewed in that light , facebook 's response to the activist campaign signals not a radical change of agenda but rather a refinement to its existing content policies .\nyet its significance for women ca n't be overstated .\nthe acceptability of speech glorifying sexual or other violence against women is a sure measure of the degree to which women 's full participation -- on a website , in any public space or in a society -- is welcome .\nfacebook is to be commended

''\nthe rays are n't exactly ratcheting down the hype .\nmanager joe maddon compares moore to vincent van gogh , saying the rays do n't want to give moore too much information for fear of distracting from his talent .\npitching coach jim hickey says moore is so polished , he 's ready to pitch 200 innings this season .\nin fact , the rays did n't even need to give him a list of objectives to improve on going into the offseason .\nmoore throws a fastball , curve and changeup and , according to hickey , the secondary pitches are off the charts : \" that is what separates him , \" says the pitching coach . \"\nsecondary pitches are usually the last things a young pitcher develops .\nhe could be successful and not need the changeup , but it is especially good for a lefty who throws in the upper 90s .

attacked him , then they tussled , he said .\nat one point , the teenager forced zimmerman to the ground -- his head hitting the pavement -- and he cried out for help .\nit was then that zimmerman , saying he had no other choice , shot martin .\nmartin 's family members say zimmerman tracked down and sought out martin , ignoring a 911 dispatcher 's directive , then shot dead the unarmed teen .\nunless there 's a plea deal , the case is dismissed or there is another unexpected turn of events , the final decision of who is right and wrong will be made by jurors .\nwhat happened the night trayvon martin died when they do , they 'll delve into mounds of evidence , key elements of which emerged well after the initial hubbub erupted .\nfor example , did martin handle the gun he was ultimately shot with ?\nno , according to test results made public last may , which showed evidence of zimmerman 's hands on the firearm , but not those of the teenager he killed .\nand an analysis showed that scrapings from underneath the teenager 's fingernails did not contain any of zimmerman 's dna , as may rub off in a prolonged struggle .\nyet zimmerman has said there was a bloody fight before the shooting , and he 's got the pictures to prove it .\nthose include photos , reportedly taken minutes after the shooting , showing streaks of blood on the back of zimmerman 's head .\nand in december , a photo posted on zimmerman 's defense web site , one that his lawyers say was taken that same winter night , showed the defendant with blood on his nose and lips .\n2 .\ngeorge zimmerman 's legal defense fund keeps pulling in cash -- and needs it as of january 2 , the fund had raised $ 314,099 , according to a web site established by zimmerman 's legal team to solicit contributions to help pay for the defense effort .\nthat 's up from the $ 180,000 zimmerman raised on his own before turning the money over to his lawyer last year .\nwhat 's the money been used for ?\nthe biggest single expense remains the $ 95,000 bond to secure his release from jail .\nthe fund has also paid $ 61,747.54 in living expenses for zimmerman and his wife , who are now living in an undisclosed

law firm and the case , and $ 3,201 in miscellaneous expenses .\nthose include zimmerman 's gps monitoring fees , office supplies and the occasional pizza for interns on the case , who work for free ,

lawsuit accusing the network of taking his comments to a 911 dispatcher out of context in an effort to sensationalize the case .\nthe lawsuit accuses the network of removing nearly a minute of dialogue and dead air between zimmerman and the dispatcher to bring comments that martin appeared to be \" up to no good \" and \" he looks black \" closer together .\nthe lawsuit also accuses nbc of falsely claiming zimmerman used a racial epithet in describing martin .\nthe network , zimmerman 's suit claims , used \" deceptive and exploitative manipulations \" to increase ratings .\nthe network 's airings of the edited recordings in march 2012 contributed to death threats that forced zimmerman into hiding , the lawsuit says .\nthe lawsuit alleges that such coverage led to death threats against zimmerman , who wears a bulletproof vest and was even dismissed from his college because it felt fellow students could be endangered .\nhe also had to move from his neighborhood in sanford , leading to various unforeseen expenses . \"\ndue to the defendants ' journalistic crimes , zimmerman has been transformed into one of the most hated men in america , \" the suit said .\nnbc universal

the guidelines might be biased and could come from an incomplete survey of the current research .\nthe 2015 report \" used weak scientific standards ( which ) seems to have made the report vulnerable to internal bias as well as outside agendas , \" food journalist nina teicholz wrote in the british medical journal .\nnutrition experts said the debate likely wo n't change the guidelines or the way consumers eat -- but it may spark frustration as they try to get a clear answer : what does a healthy diet look like ?\nthe 2015 dietary guidelines report relied on existing reviews of the evidence base , rather than conducting original reviews , but the committee left out important studies , according to teicholz , who wrote the book , \" the big fat surprise : why butter , meat and cheese belong in a healthy diet . \"\nthe reviews have examined , for example , clinical trials and observational studies on whether there is a link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease and have come up with conflicting results .\nthe result is that the 2015 dietary guidelines report overstated the evidence for the health risks of saturated fats and understated the importance of a low-carbohydrate diet , teicholz said .\nalthough the recent report broke with earlier publications by exonerating cholesterol and avoiding a limit on total fats in the diet , it did state that saturated fats should not exceed 10 % of total calories . \"\ni think ( teicholz ) has really put her finger on something important here , \" said jeff volek , a professor of human sciences at ohio state university , who has criticized the dietary guidelines in the past . \"\nthe committee certainly missed the boat on a lot of existing data \" that suggest saturated fats are not associated with heart disease and other chronic health problems , volek said .\nhe argued that the advisory committee did n't give enough credit to some large analyses , as well as some of his own studies on saturated fat and heart disease .\nadvice to restrict saturated fat has backfired , volek said , because people replaced those calories with carbohydrates and sugar , and rates of obesity and diabetes in the country continue to rise .\ninstead , diets low in carbohydrates and without limits on saturated fats should be an option , especially for people with diabetes and prediabetes , he said .\nhe noted that the 2015 report does include some changes he sees as positive , such as not recommending a limit on total fat .\nbarbara millen , chairwoman of the most recent advisory committee , told cnn that all of the best studies on saturated fat and carbohydrates were considered for the report .\nto be included , studies had to meet a long list of criteria , such as looking at health effects of dietary components over a long enough period of time .\nthe committee relied on existing analyses of research only if they included the most relevant studies , said millen , who is president of millennium prevention , a company that develops technologies to manage diseases such as obesity , diabetes and heart disease .\nif not , the advisory committee commissioned its own original analyses .\ncriticism of the british medical journal piece was published in the verge , which said some of the studies teicholz noted were not relevant or were outside of the purview of the report .\nthe focus of the committee 's report , the verge writer noted , is on maintaining health and not on preventing disease .\nthe british medical journal article raises the possibility of conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines advisory committee .\nfor example , millen 's millennium prevention sells mobile apps for monitoring health , and the report recommends self-monitoring technologies .\nother members of the committee have received research funding from companies that make vegetable oil products and groups that advocate eating nuts .\nthere could be pressure to maintain status quo guidelines , possibly because scientists have staked their careers on certain dietary paradigms or because of pressure from food industry groups , volek said .\nthe committee might

{"document": "by mary jo foley , special to fortune fortune -- on the eve of his exit as chief executive officer of microsoft , after more then a decade on the job , it is more evident than ever that steve ballmer 's image does not always reflect reality .\nas anyone who has ever seen him speak at a conference ( or portrayed on television , as he was in cartoon form on the animated series south park this year ) knows , ballmer is a larger-than-life kind of guy .\nhis public persona is brash , bombastic and , at times , bordering on boorish .\nto most people , he is known more for his manner than his management .\nbut look closely , and you 'll notice that the real steve ballmer is responsible for making a handful of largely unsung strategic decisions during his tenure as ceo of microsoft ( msft ) that will continue to affect the company and industry long after a new leader takes the helm of the redmond , wash.-based company .\nfor example , it was ballmer who made it a priority to settle the hundreds of antitrust , class-action and other lawsuits facing the company when he was appointed chief executive in january 2000 .\nit was ballmer who championed microsoft 's foray into the living room , starting in 2001 with the xbox gaming console .\nballmer was key to microsoft evolving into an enterprise powerhouse , grasping early the financial and strategic importance of courting it professionals .\nballmer also brought a new level of business rigor to the company , which led to it shedding a number of products and business units that could n't demonstrate their \" monetizability . \"\nto be fair , ballmer has admitted publicly and repeatedly that he goofed badly with managing and overseeing longhorn , the delayed engineering project which ultimately debuted as the ill-received windows vista operating system .\nbut in a recent interview with fortune , he adamantly insisted he got more right than wrong during the 13 years he ran microsoft .\nstarting with money : under ballmer , microsoft 's profits doubled , revenues tripled . \"\nin the last five years , probably apple has made more money than we have , \" ballmer says during a sit-down in his office in redmond , in what 's expected to be his final press interview as ceo . \"\nbut in the last 13 years , i bet we 've made more money than almost anybody on the planet .\nand that , frankly , is a great source of pride to me . \"\nthere have been missteps along the way to those profits .\nlike microsoft 's $ 6 billion acquisition in 2007 of the online ad firm aquantive , on which the company took a $ 6.2 billion write-down five years later after failing to capitalize on its products and services .\nor the purchase of mobile services company danger in 2008 , which spawned the short-lived microsoft kin family of mobile phones .\nthere were some close calls , too , such as microsoft 's scrapped purchase of yahoo for $ 45 billion in 2008 .\nbut there have been several decisions that did pan out .\none of those was fast search & transfer , which microsoft bought in 2008 for $ 1.2 billion and integrated into the enterprise search technology at the heart of microsoft 's very profitable sharepoint family .\nanother was navision a/s , which the company bought in 2002 for $ 1.5 billion and ultimately turned into the heart of its now thriving dynamics erp business . \"\nhave we made mostly good acquisitions ? \"\nballmer asks , rhetorically . \"\nthe answer is yes .\nwe really have made mostly good acquisitions .\nwe spent a billion dollars on fast ; we make good money .\ndynamics , we did two acquisitions , each just over a billion — believe you me , they look really good .\nsome of them take a little longer to kick in .\nthe aquantive acquisition ?\nobviously not a good acquisition .\nbut in the company we were , it 's about acquiring in addition to managing costs and getting price .\nand we have been very good at that . \"\nwhen microsoft co-founder and then-chief executive bill gates hired ballmer from procter & gamble in 1980 , it was to be \" the business guy , whatever that meant , \" ballmer says .\nsince that day , his rallying cry has always been \" how do you make money ?\nhow do you make money ?\nhow do you make money ? \"\n( imagine him chanting this in the same way he hollered \" developers , developers , developers ! \"\nat a now-famous company summit in 2000 .\nnow picture him doing so , calmly , as he kicks back in an upholstered chair in his office in building 34 on the company 's redmond campus . )\n\" that does n't mean nobody else ever thought about it , but ' how do you make money ? '\nwas what i got hired to do , \" ballmer says . \"\ni 've always thought that way . \"\nas ceo , ballmer brought a new level of business rigor to microsoft .\ninstead of allowing hundreds of products to bloom because they sounded potentially interesting or trendy , ballmer required of business justification , often in excruciating detail .\nonly then would he give new businesses his stamp of approval . \"\ni would say that it has been a hallmark of mine since arrival , \" ballmer says . \"\ni 've always had the unique , valuable perspective of being on the front line selling , working with our partners , because in some senses your ability to understand how to make money is heavily shaped by what you think people will pay for , in addition to what it costs to get things done . \"\nin 2005 , he hired kevin turner from wal-mart stores , where he was executive vice president , to become microsoft 's chief operating officer .\nturner upped the rigor even further with tools like \" scorecards \" for measuring customer satisfaction and other key sales metrics . \"\nballmer 's famous statement is , ' if you deal with me , you deal in detail , ' \" says satya nadella , executive vice president of microsoft 's cloud and server business . \"\nif you do n't have the details , do n't give him the stuff . \"\nballmer 's notoriously outgoing personality also helped microsoft strike deals .\nhis early career experience in sales translated well during corporate negotiations , particularly in assisting the company to settle the numerous lawsuits that faced the company early in his tenure .\nwhen ballmer took over as ceo , microsoft was in the midst of fighting a bitter antitrust complaint brought against the company in 1998 by the u.s. government and 20 states .\nfor several years , gates ' attitude suggested that he would rather fight the claims than settle ; upon replacing gates , ballmer made it a top priority for the company to put the cases behind it as quickly as possible .\nit was less about the cost and more about public perception , he says . \"\nbeing the object of a lawsuit , effectively , or a complaint from your government is a very awkward , uncomfortable position to be in , \" ballmer says . \"\nit just has all downside .\npeople assume if the government brought a complaint that there 's really a problem , and your ability to say we 're a good , proper , moral place is tough .\nit 's actually tough , even though you feel that way about yourselves . \"\nmultiply that several times over and you get a sense of what ballmer inherited .\nbrad smith , microsoft 's general counsel , recalls that the company was facing antitrust investigations in 20 other countries , plus 206 additional class-action lawsuits against microsoft in 40 states and the district of columbia .\nadd to that another set of complaints pending from 12 competitors , including sun microsystems , aol and ibm , and it 's clear that the company had a major distraction on its hands , he said . \"\ni would just say it was probably the biggest sort of legal overhang that any major company really had to address between say probably 1990 and 2010 , in that twenty-year period , \" smith says .\nsettling the cases ended up costing microsoft between $ 5 billion and $ 6 billion , smith says .\n( by 2005 , most of the settlements were finalized . )\nballmer 's pragmatism , his relationship-building skills and his sense of calm — yes , you read that correctly — were all key to getting it done , smith says . \"\nsteve has great interpersonal skills , \" smith says . \"\ni think he 's always had this ability to connect with other people , to listen to other people , and i think those skills were well-honed in the years that he led the sales force for microsoft .\nand so he was able to bring a unique set of skills that were put to the test as ceo in his first year of doing this . \"\nballmer also played a significant role in building microsoft to become one of the largest technology providers to big businesses .\ntoday , microsoft maintains a $ 20 billion enterprise business .\nthis was n't always the case ; microsoft began as a consumer-hobbyist company . \"\npeople think of microsoft as having inherited its enterprise software company chops by virtue of windows and office , \" says andrew brust , founder of blue badge insights , a microsoft-focused analyst firm in new york city . \"\nthat 's revisionist , though .\nthe truth is that exchange , windows server , sql server , sharepoint , system center and dynamics crm each faced an uphill battle .\nmicrosoft persevered , and now each of these products is either a major player in its category or dominates it altogether .\nthat 's the genesis of microsoft 's enterprise juggernaut , and it was built slowly and steadily on ballmer 's watch . \"\nballmer says that it took many years to shift public perception of the company . \"\nit 's really only the last five or six years that people say we 're right for the enterprise , \" he says . \"\nnow people say we 're like , ' born for the enterprise . '\nbut i would say as recently as about 2007 or 2008 , we 'd still have people who would say we were n't an enterprise supplier at all . \"\nthat 's particularly surprising since , in 1988 under gates , microsoft hired dave cutler , the celebrated father of the vms minicomputer operating system , to help write a brand-new operating system for businesses : windows nt .\nballmer cites this period , when the company gradually added networking and database field expertise to its repertoire , as important in informing his later management of microsoft 's enterprise businesses .\nit 's when he gained first-hand exposure to customers ' requirements and expectations around pricing and licensing , he says .\nit 's when he forged relationshipswith reseller partners who knew how to sell to the enterprise .\nand it 's why , as ceo , he made it a priority to invest more in support and services . \"\nwe just kept hell-bent and determined — in a good way , in a positive way — to prove that we could be enterprise-worthy , \" ballmer says .\nand \" that 's one [ area ] that i feel particular unique sponsorship for .\ni feel particularly good about having pushed that . \"\nballmer was n't all business-focused , however .\none of his first major decisions as ceo was whether or not microsoft should enter the gaming market with the xbox .\ngates was all-in , but ballmer says he considered his approval of the device to be a turning point for him to establish himself as the new chief executive .\ngetting into the living room with the xbox ?\nthat \" was my decision , my accountability , \" ballmer says . \"\ni believe in accountability .\ni 'm in .\ni 'm accountable .\ni 'll make this work — not that i had to drive it — but we had some bumps on the road .\nand it was important that i stay accountable , stay patient , and stay behind the decision that we made . \"\nrobbie bach , the former head of microsoft 's entertainment and devices division and head of xbox from the launch of the original xbox in 2001 , remembers ballmer spending six months conducting a thorough business review to determine whether there was actually opportunity for microsoft before giving the team the go-ahead .\nhe made the call one month into his new role . \"\nhe was willing to step out into a space that microsoft had never been in , look at a business model , and say this is something we need to try , \" bach says .\nsince 2000 , microsoft has spent billions to expand in a market that has evolved to encompass the entire living room .\nwhat began as a device that used a non-windows operating system written almost entirely from scratch has become a dominant console and entry point in the growing connected television ecosystem .\neven when the console hit speed bumps — competing on price against sony , microsoft took a loss on the first generation ; faced with \" red ring of death \" console glitches , microsoft took a billion-dollar write-off in 2008 against the second generation — ballmer backed the team every step of the way , bach says . \"\nit is easy to bemoan billions spent on xbox , \" says charles fitzgerald , a former microsoft strategist and current tech investor , \" but when you look at it as a hedge to keep sony or any game console from undermining the windows pc , it is chump change compared to the hundreds of billions in windows profits banked during that time . \"\nas ballmer prepares for his exit , he leaves many questions unanswered .\ndid he protect microsoft 's crown jewels , windows and office , for too long at the expense of pursuing new businesses enabled by technologies such as cloud computing and mobile devices ?\nhas he been too slow in overseeing microsoft 's transition from being the samson of software to the devices and services company he claims he wants it to be ? \"\ni think we will look back and conclude that for microsoft , the biggest challenge was the sheer scope of the company , \" says fitzgerald , who has publicly opined that he thinks microsoft ought to be three \" svelte \" companies rather than one single mega-corporation .\nsitting cross-legged in his office chair , ballmer refuses to concede that microsoft is too big or in need of any kind of divestiture to succeed . \"\ni do think we 're far more focused than we were when i took over , \" ballmer says . \"\nand that 's partly a function of the time .\nwe 've gone from being a complete leader to a leader and a challenger , both in the same body .\nand when you 're a challenger , you do have to pick and choose and be more focused . \"\nmicrosoft employees used to believe \" that we could just make things , just develop part of something and it would take off , \" ballmer says .\nthese days , \" i do n't believe that , \" he says .\nwe 'll soon see if that view is one that his successor holds , too .", "summary": "as microsoft prepares to announce a new ceo , we ask steve ballmer to take a look at the legacy he leaves on the technology company ."}

a landscape that 's at once starkly beautiful , sensationally dramatic and incredibly rare .\ngeologists will tell you that namibia 's dunes are built and shaped by wind and carved by water .\nthey are believed to be 60 million to 80 million years old , made of sand pushed inland over the eons from the coast by atlantic ocean winds that sweep onshore 80 kilometers to the west .\nhere , near the settlement of sesriem , westerly winds from the naukluft mountains to the east collide with the atlantic winds , stopping the dunes ' advance .\nwhen the wind from the west meets the wind from the east , the sand is pushed upward like the ocean waves the dunes resemble .\nit forms almost perfectly symmetrical \" star \" dunes , each with several arms extending outward from the summit .\nthe eastern mountains do n't face the entire expanse of dunes , so the wind cuts the sossusvlei valley into a \" u \" shape .\nthe result is a region of sharply defined massive sculpted sand piles surrounding a vast valley .\nwater too has shaped this region , although mostly it is long gone .\nthe ephemeral tsauchab river flows nearby , but only during rainy periods .\nthe water storms through the dune valley , but the dunes stop its advance .\nit pushes forward and gathers into small lakes at the base of the dunes but often quickly dries up .\nin a few spots , the water remains , forming

material offered information about including : on osama bin laden : the guardian examined documents that allegedly link bin laden to several incidents between 2004 and 2009 .\nexamples : – osama bin laden reported to have issued orders to suicide bombers in afghanistan – afghanistan war logs : bin laden instigates suicide attack against afghan president hamid karzai , according to u.s. report on

that opened in patkia province of afghanistan in which the local director was given a leather jacket .\nthe first document , dated nov 2006 , shows an american civil affairs officer enthusiastic about the orphanage ’s opening .\na few months later , a document describing an inspection reveals that only 30 orphans are at the center when there is supposed to be more 100 .\nthe third document , more than a year later , reveals that there are no orphans in the orphanage .\nder spiegel on german military problems : spiegel looks at documents that allegedly illustrate little progress by the german

by our enemy ( terrorism ) not pakistan .\nif we want to win and we want our ally ( pakistan ) to win we need to stop pointing fingers at pakistan , and take some responsibility and work with them to get rid of this evil , and not become like india by ignoring a part of their population ( kashmiris ) and then wondering where they went wrong .\nyup lets use one case to generalize about why legal us citizens are terrorists and illegal latinos are simply law abiding citizens .\nif you only knew the prison population of the united states , you would urge us to throw out blacks and hispanics from our country .\nmoron .\nthats right vanessa deal with it , your afraid these illegal immigrants are gioing to take away your welfare check , i am elated for the authorities ( local , state and federal as well ) for their actions being taken on a suspect like him .\nonly time will tell if his missintentions were real or he was just playing games in times where awareness is at its highest points .\nby the way , can airspace security be relegated to the private sector so no more serious financial waste and incidents ever happen , uh ?\nyeah truth maybe your trailer park will be safer now , wow

only the us citizen but his children all over the world from the evil ones !\n.\ntherefore you ( american ) should thank to god who is protecting you for this danger .\non the other hand , god can allow the bad thing to happen such as 9/11 so that people will repent to him like in the sodom and gomorah .\nthe bible never says that god would not let bad things happen such as the bad people hurt good people .\ninstead the bible : \" all things work for good for those who loves jesus \" .\nso please start thanking the blessing that god gives to you daily !\nposted by : hg from australia oh ,

extreme religious fundamentalism from all sides that continually causes this abhorrent behaviour .\nthank the people who averted this attack on innocents ... but leave god and religion out of it ...

instills some brains into people who are not simply lemmings but can actually decipher biblical passages for there actual message and stop taking everything so literally and without any thought .\ni call those people \" hypo-christians \" ... hypocritical people who twist things to suit their own needs and take everything out of context ... devoid of any common sense .\nomg !\nwould you please stop with the minute by minute updates !\nsomeone planted a poorly made bomb , he was arrested ... move on !\ni find it funny that here is one man , one \" bomb \" and it is automatically terrorism .\nbut take a group of christians planning to kill police or 1 christian flying a plane into a government building and no one mentions \" terrorist \" .\noh my !\nthank god ???\nif you want to go ahead , but please thank the fbi , law officers , all of them whom are so intelligent to know , seek and find !\njust be thankful already !\nthis could have been very tragic .\nmy only other comment would be this .... i sure wish this country would \" stop \" with the citizenship !!!!!\nwe are in no shape to be allowing anyone the right to stay here .\nif they really wanted to stay and were stand up people , they would have gone through the proper processing long ago .\nthis country is far from out of the woods on these attacks and we can not afford to keep allowing this !!!\nespecially the ones that commit crimes and are arrested !\nyou get arrested and you are not a citizen , no three strike or felony rule , ship them back !!!!\nyou are right alan !\ndone , move on .\nand for the

pakistani would bomb the worlds biggest taxi stand ... is it the serious lack of facial hair that is required by taliban law to get a taxi license ... ?\nprotect our country at any cost ... from both foreign and domestic threats , terrorism should never be tolerated ! \"\nand as far as using god , be glad that you are in america and able to practice you religious beliefs !\nwhatever they may be ?

advance to sway away from the current topic to move to a more specific issue : everyone is aware by now that terrorism anywhere in the world is stemming or linked or connected to pakistan .\nweather we like it or not pakistan is the epicenter .\n( dosent mean pakistanis are !!! )\n.\ni feel pakistan needs help , it is a failed state , the democratic government is a puppet of the isi and the army and the taliban .\nthey are just there to keep good relations with usa and other allies to help them get money for fighting afghanistan .\ni feel badly for people of afghanistan and iraq , they have been under the wrath for no crime of theirs .\ni donot feel the same about pakistani people , the reason being , the people there have the power to overthrow the government , isi , army or the taliban .\nif the people of pakistan are not fundamentalist , are not thinking against other religion weather its christians or hindus , then why are they not protesting the existing system ?\nwhy is there not a martin luther or a gandhi out there ?\ntoday international media picks up even a dog barks in some corner of the world , if the people of pakistan hold peaceful protests , i am sure the world media , western governments and even india will support the people of pakistan to get rid of these terrorist sponsors in their country .\nthe bottom line is that do the people of pakistan really want to get rid of them ?\nor they are fine with it ?\nor they dont really care ?\ni personally thank god for not allowing that car bomb to explode .\nbut i have 2 questions : is faisal shahzad ( the suspect ) the same \" white male \" in the video that the media was showing us all the time , the same \" dark skined middle eastern male \" that they arested ?\n2 .\nhow in the heck did he make it all the way out on a plane ready to take off on the tarmack ?\nwere they still looking for a white male suspect ?\ngood grief !!\nu2-one .\n.\ns it getting better or do you feel the same will it make it easier on you now you got someone to blame you say one love one life when it 's one need in the night it 's one love we get to share it it leaves you baby if you do n't care for it did i disappoint you ?\nor leave a bad taste in your mouth ?\nyou act like you never had love and you want me to go without well it 's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light we 're one but we 're not the same we get to carry each other carry each other one have you come here for forgiveness have you come tor raise the dead have you come here to play jesus to the lepers in your head did i ask too much more than a lot you gave me nothing now it 's all i got we 're one but we 're not the same we hurt each other then we do it again you say love is a temple love a higher law love is a temple love the

cure the hearts of these evil people so they would repent their perversion in the name of a great religion .\nmy point exactly , there are fanatics everywhere , it is not fair to blame pakistan for what one american citizen did .\nalthough , pakistan is at fault for not getting rid of all the fanatics in its borders , just like india and we are at blame .\nand to the different reader , no i am not southern or white trash , but a red-blooded new englander liberal and ivy league educated , and just say it like it is .\nplease do not include india in the same category as pakistan .\nwe have a 240 million muslim and we sure have problems like any other country , but do not go to extremes and kill people .\nindia and america are blessed unlike pakistan .\ni hope pakistan will eliminate the perversion and cleans up itself sooner for its own good .\ni do not hate pakistan but pakistan is no where never india or america in its human values .\nyou are right , india more than doubles the people who die because of aids or hunger .\nto make it fair , even the percentage of people who die in india because of aids or hunger is terrible to look at .\nso you are right we ca n't compare india to u.s or pakistan .\nhowever , on that note we ca n't compare paksitan to u.s because of their violation of women 's rights .\nso the only certain thing is that india ca n't be compared to us ,

ironic that out commitment to openness and liberty protects our freedom to act so utterly contrary to our own self-interest .\nironic also is that the whole affair is being characterized as \" a bomb

{"document": "( cnn ) -- they dress like allies , but they kill like enemies .\ngunmen wearing afghan military uniforms turning against coalition troops has been an ongoing nightmare for nato 's international security assistance forces .\nit happened again tuesday , when a man believed to be an afghan soldier killed u.s. army maj. gen. harold greene and shot several others at a military training facility in kabul .\nit 's impossible to tell if or when the next \" green-on-blue \" attack might occur .\nbut here 's what we do know : how often do these attacks happen ?\nsuch assaults were rare in the first few years of the afghan war , averaging no more than one a year through 2008 , according to the new america foundation .\nbut after the \" surge \" of 33,000 u.s. troops in 2009 , the number of insider attacks jumped to four .\nthe attacks spiked in 2012 with 48 , according to a pentagon report .\nthe incidents have declined since then , with 15 attacks in 2013 and two in the first quarter of 2014 , as more troops withdraw and coalition forces try new ways of mitigating the attacks . \"\ndespite this sharp decline , these attacks may still have strategic effects on the campaign and could jeopardize the relationship between coalition and ansf ( afghan national security forces ) personnel , \" a u.s. defense department report said .\nwho carries out these attacks ?\nsometimes it 's actual afghan soldiers or police officers ; sometimes it 's insurgents such as taliban militants disguised as afghan security forces .\nthe taliban acknowledged gen. greene 's killing tuesday , but has n't claimed responsibility for it .\npentagon spokesman rear adm. john kirby said officials believe an afghan soldier was the gunman .\nan isaf official said the group of coalition forces was standing outside , and the attacker shot from inside a nearby building at a distance of about 100 yards .\nthe pentagon is n't commenting on the possibility of taliban involvement , saying the afghan military and international forces are in the early stages of an investigation .\nbut the taliban have claimed responsibility for previous attacks .\nthe terror group even released a video showing how their fighters trained to break through the fence at camp bastion , the site of a 2012 assault that left two u.s. marines dead and six jets destroyed .\nnato said the taliban militants were wearing u.s. army uniforms .\nthey also carried automatic rifles , rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests .\nthe intentions can run the gamut .\nwitnessing the horrors of war sometimes inspires soldiers to turn against their onetime allies , said philip mudd , a cnn counterterrorism analyst and former cia official .\nin 2012 , the deadliest year of insider attacks , a defense department official said the united states estimated 40 % of them were due to afghan members ' own combat or emotional stress , and 15 % are a result of intimidation by the insurgency or actually being recruited by it .\nthe official said about 10 % came from impersonators who are not part of the military .\nbut in more than 30 % of the assaults , no clear motivations were found .\nin many cases , such as in tuesday 's attack , the answer might never be known because the assailant was killed .\nhow does the afghan military vet its soldiers ?\nmilitary recruits are vetted by their high school grades , an entrance exam , a health screening and biometrics , said daulat waziri , deputy spokesman for the afghan ministry of defense .\nthey must also pass a background check and provide two references who are government employees .\nit 's still unclear whether the gunman in tuesday 's attack had taliban ties or whether he slipped through the military 's screening process . \"\ni do n't think we should look and make judgments about the vetting process too quickly , \" mudd said . \"\nyou would think on the surface that maybe he was recruited by the taliban .\nthat 's not necessarily the case . \"\nwhat about allied forces turning against afghan civilians ?\nin march 2012 , u.s. army staff sgt.\nrobert bales slipped away from the camp where he was stationed and into a village in kandahar province , where he began shooting at civilians .\nhe returned to the base , reloaded , and went out again to target another village .\nhe left a trail of blood and gore in both villages , with nine children among the dead .\nwitnesses claimed the u.s. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims ' outside and set them ablaze .\nby the end of the rampage , 16 villagers were dead .\nbales was charged with murder and eventually sentenced to life in prison .\nbales described his attack as \" an act of cowardice \" and said he 'd taken steroids and drank sporadically .\nthe taliban vowed to retaliate \" by killing and beheading americans anywhere in the country . \"\nwhat can be done to mitigate insider attacks ?\ncoalition forces have started using what they call \" guardian angels , \" or armed troops who oversee others during meal times and when soldiers are sleeping .\ntwo years ago , after the deadliest spate of attacks , troops started receiving a fold-up pamphlet called \" inside the wire threats - afghanistan green on blue \" to help prevent such assaults .\na defense department official said it advises troops under attack who have their own weapons on them to \" resolve the situation with forces at hand \" and not wait for backup .\nunarmed troops at meetings or dining halls have been vulnerable in the past , but now , all are carrying their weapons , preloaded with a magazine of ammunition .\nweapons must be within arm 's reach at all times , according to u.s. military sources .\nthe pamphlet also offers broad indicators of behaviors by afghans that could indicate they are a threat , the defense department official said .\nthings to watch for include complaints about other countries or religions , comments that advocate violence , a personality change , becoming isolated and not wanting to be around others , speaking in favor of radical ideology or showing an undue interest in coalition base headquarters or living quarters .\nbut

capitalist -- an attack line shared by gingrich but criticized by santorum and other conservatives .\nafter previously describing romney 's former company , bain capital , as corporate \" vultures \" who looted north carolina companies , perry used less combative language sunday on cnn 's \" state of the union \" but reiterated his accusation that it \" came in and basically shut down \" a

debater and stronger candidate than romney .\non nbc , gingrich also said he would release his tax return on thursday and reiterated his challenge for romney to do the same , continuing a campaign to get romney to disclose details of his personal wealth .\nromney has said he has complied with legal disclosure obligations , but added he might release his tax returns or further information in the

here in the state and across the states to support us and to help our cause , \" said santorum , a former pennsylvania senator who was virtually tied for fourth in new hampshire with gingrich .\nthe christian conservative endorsement was intended to unite evangelical voters behind one candidate to avoid a split that would hand romney victory despite south carolina 's conservative pedigree .

make the case to the voters and then we 'll see what happens . \"\nscott , who won election in 2010 with strong support from the tea party movement , told nbc that the impact of the evangelical vote -- a typically large bloc in south carolina -- will be \" huge \" on saturday . \"\nit 's hard to find a single candidate that rallies all of the christian voters in south carolina and therefore that splintered approach will probably have a major impact in the state 's primary , \" scott said .\nmeanwhile .\nromney 's record at bain capital , a private equity firm , continued to be a major topic

bain capital as corporate raiders more devoted to profits than people .\nasked about erroneous information in the ads and video , gingrich called sunday for the super pac to edit out incorrect

n't there .\nhe 's not a monster , he 's a cipher .\nnothing seems to get a rise out of him .\nhearing a bit of his story as the defense builds its case for why the jury should spare his life , it 's easy to see how tsarnaev learned to get by in a chaotic family by becoming agreeable to the point of being invisible .\nhis teachers loved him .\nfive came to court and testified on behalf of a boy who grew up to be perhaps the most hated man in boston .\nthey remembered him as smart and sweet-natured , with shining brown eyes .\nit 's so clear he had potential , and that 's another tragic element to a case already overloaded with tragedy .\nthe defense showed how even his own mother , zubeidat , undermined that potential .\nshe let her own pride get in the way .\na teacher told the story of how zubeidat tsarnaev pulled her son out of a prestigious charter school known for getting its students \" full-ticket \" scholarships to good colleges .\nwhy ?\nshe was angry he 'd been sent home for wearing the wrong color of pants .\njahar wore blue pants , and the family was too poor to buy him a brown pair , his mother said in an angry phone call to the school .\nthe teacher asked jahar , as he was known , whether it would help if she called and talked to his mother .\nno , please do n't , he responded .\nhe was starting the ninth grade , and he 'd already learned not to make waves at home .\nzubeidat was flashy and loud and demanded attention .\nshe was over the top in her ambitions for her oldest child , tamerlan .\nhe was going to harvard , she 'd brag .\nhe was going to box in the olympics .\nof course it did n't work out that way .\nwe did n't hear a peep about her hopes for her youngest , jahar .\nthe landlady came to his middle school graduation .\nthere were

baby 's other grandmother .\nrussell 's daughter , katherine , dropped out of college and married tamerlan tsarnaev .\nshe had met him at a nightclub and fell hard .\nthe defense displayed a photo of the couple , strolling hand-in-hand .\nthe leaves on the trees were turning gold and the scene looked like a hallmark card .\nbut tamerlan proved to be a toxic force in the life of a young woman who had been blond , pretty and outgoing .\nhe came between \" katie , \" as she was called , and her family .\njudith russell said her daughter became isolated .\ntamerlan 's presence in her life also created distance with her best friend since childhood , gina crawford .\ntamerlan was unfaithful more than once , and he may have been violent with katie , who converted to islam and changed her name to karima tsarnaeva .\nshe was the breadwinner .\nbut when company came for dinner , she cooked , served the men and then retired to another room .\nwhen people saw them on the street , she invariably walked a few paces behind her husband .\nby then , anzor and zubeidat were splitting up .\nmother and son were delving deeply into radical islam -- and coming to the attention of authorities in russia and the united states .\ntamerlan headed to russia for six months , looking to join the holy warriors of jihad .\nthey called it \" going into the forest . \"\nhe left his bride and baby behind .\non katherine 's macbook laptop , authorities later found searches for information about \" rewards \" for the wives of martyrs and holy warriors .\nbut people who care about katie russell insist she had no idea about her husband 's plans to bomb the finish line of the boston marathon .\nshe is n't on anybody 's witness list , and she has n't been charged with anything .\nafter tamerlan returned to cambridge , his parents headed to russia -- separately .\nthey 're still there , and are n't expected to make an appearance at the trial .\nthat left tamerlan , the eldest son , as the head of a family that included his wife , daughter and brother jahar .\nwhile his wife worked , tamerlan spent his days at home , sending his wife and brother emails with attachments of videos and lectures he found on al qaeda websites .\njahar went off to college at the university of massachusetts dartmouth , some 60 miles to the south .\nnone of his friends had a clue about his extracurricular activities in the world of radical islam .\nthey knew him from \" bro nights , \" the regular off-campus gatherings of a close group of friends from cambridge .\nthe defense says jahar was trying to build his own life , but was becoming unmoored .\nhe was flunking out of school .\nand he was still in tamerlan 's toxic orbit .\nfor the first couple of days of the defense case , it seemed like we 'd been transported to another courtroom and another trial -- united states of america vs. tamerlan tsarnaev .\nonce again , jahar seemed like an afterthought at his own capital murder trial , just as he had been throughout his life .\neven after he was shot up and handcuffed , his first question was : \" where 's my brother ? \"\ntamerlan was the martyr .\nhe made sure of that .\nhe walked into a volley of police bullets .\nwhen he ran out of bullets , he hurled his gun at a cop .\nand then he was run over by jahar , who was trying to escape in a stolen mercedes suv .\ntoward the end of an abbreviated week of testimony , the defense started to change up the story line , presenting people who thought they knew jahar and cared about him .\ntwo young women who were part of his \" bro night \" gatherings testified for him and then cried as they stepped down from the witness stand .\nthe last time they were all together , it was spring break two years ago .\nthey were shooting off fireworks from jahar 's backpack along the banks of the charles river .\njahar was dancing through the sparks . \"\nhe was being really silly , \" said 21-year-old alexa guevara .\nand then she stepped off the witness stand and started to sob so loudly that people in the courtroom could hear her from the hallway .\nand that 's when i felt sorry for jahar -- and for anybody who ever cared about him -- because genuine tragedy comes in more than one dimension .\nthree of his college \" bros \" may be starting their adult lives in federal prison because they cleaned out his dorm room and helped ditch his backpack and laptop .\nthe sad truth is , jahar probably would n't be on trial for his life if not for his big brother .\npeople would n't be arguing over whether he should live or

for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles , \" kurtzer told cnn on monday .\negypt 's turmoil follows years of social , political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated .\nafter ruling with an iron fist for three decades , mubarak had given no indication of giving up power before his statement tuesday night .\nhowever , elbaradei and other opposition figures immediately condemned mubarak 's announcement as insufficient , saying the president needed to step aside immediately for a caretaker government of national unity to lead egypt until new presidential and parliamentary elections can be held .\nobama 's statement avoided addressing the opposition demands , instead promising the demonstrators -- particularly young egyptians looking to the united states for support and leadership -- that america supported their aspirations . \"\nwe hear your voices , \" obama said . \"\ni have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren .\nand i say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the united states and egypt . \"\nthere will be difficult days ahead , \" obama continued . \"\nmany questions about egypt 's future remain unanswered , but i am confident that the people of egypt will find those answers . \"\nin the past week , demonstrators in egypt have questioned why obama , who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in cairo , was n't condemning mubarak and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek .\nelbaradei , who returned to his native egypt last week as an opposition figure last week , said egyptians need to see that the united states is supporting their aspirations . \"\npeople need to see that you not only talk the talk , but walk the walk , and people need to understand and believe that you really , seriously take democracy , rule of law , freedoms seriously , \" elbaradei said sunday .\nasking \" a dictator \" to implement democratic reforms \" is an oxymoron , frankly . \"\non monday , white house press secretary robert gibbs said egypt 's government should engage in \" meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society , including opposition groups , \" and hold \" free and fair elections \" in september .\nthe transition called for by the united states \" means change , and what we 've advocated from the very beginning is that the way egypt looks and operates must change , \" gibbs told reporters .\nat the same time , he said it is not the place of the united states to support or oppose the possible ouster of mubarak .\nsome u.s. politicians disagreed .\none of the u.s. senate 's most influential foreign policy voices , democrat john kerry of massachusetts , called tuesday for mubarak to step down , reflecting the rapidly changing consensus among top washington policymakers .\nkerry , the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and the 2004 democratic presidential nominee , also said mubarak 's son , gamal , should not take the reins of power in cairo .\nthe u.s. government needs to start paying closer attention to the \" genuine political , legal and economic needs \" of people in the middle east , as opposed to consistently

{"document": "by daniel burke , cnn belief blog editor ( cnn ) - so , a rabbi , a sheikh and a pope travel to the holy land … it might sound like the start of a trite joke , but it ’s actually the entourage for one of the most highly anticipated papal trips in recent history .\nas pope francis heads to jordan , bethlehem and jerusalem this weekend , he ’s bringing along two old friends from argentina : rabbi abraham skorka , who co-wrote a book with the pope , and sheikh omar abboud , who leads argentina ’s muslim community .\nthe vatican says it ’s the first time that a pope ’s official entourage has included interfaith leaders .\nin a region roiled by competing religious and political visions , francis ’ chosen companions communicate an unmistakable message , church officials said .\n“ it ’s highly symbolic , of course , ” said the rev.\nthomas rosica , a consultant to the vatican press office .\n“ but it also sends a pragmatic message to muslims , christians and jews that it ’s possible to work together - not as a system of checks and balances but as friends .\n” the visit to the holy land is the first for francis as leader of the roman catholic church , and just the fourth for any pontiff in the modern era .\nwith so much at stake - the stalled negotiations between israelis and palestinians , the plight of christian refugees - the pope ’s every word , gesture and photo-op will be microscopically examined .\nalready , some conservative israelis are advocating against the pope ’s visit , scrawling anti-christian graffiti on catholic buildings in jerusalem and planning protests outside papal events in jerusalem .\nwhile the protesters form a fringe minority , they underscore the tensions that simmer around the pope ’s short but substantial trip .\nwith those challenges in mind , here are five key things to pay particular attention to .\n1 .\nthe pope ’s schedule makes rick steves look lazy .\nit ’s a good thing the 77-year-old pontiff rested up this week .\nfrancis will be traveling to three cities , shaking hands with dozens of religious and political leaders , celebrating several catholic masses and delivering at least 13 speeches and homilies – all in less than 36 hours .\nin jordan , the pope will meet with king abdullah ii , greet refugees from iraq and syria , celebrate mass and visit the jordan river , where many christians believe jesus was baptized .\nin bethlehem , he will convene with the president of the palestinian authority , celebrate mass in manger square , lunch with palestinian families , greet children from refugee camps and visit the site of jesus ’ birth .\nin jerusalem , the pope will meet the city ’s grand mufti and chief rabbis , visit the western wall and yad vashem ( a memorial to the holocaust ) , lay a wreath on the grave of the founder of modern zionism , and sign a joint declaration with the head of eastern orthodox christians .\nhe ’ll also confer with israel ’s prime minister and president , chat with catholic seminarians and celebrate mass at the site of the last supper .\n“ i ’m amazed at what they are trying to do in such a short amount of time , ” rosica said .\n2 .\nthe pope says the trip is religious , not political .\nfrancis has called the reasons behind his holy land excursion “ strictly religious .\n” earlier , he had described it as a “ pilgrimage for prayer .\n” perhaps the popular pontiff was trying to tamp down expectations that his visit could solve the region ’s seemingly intractable political problems .\nbut the trip does have religious roots , church officials say .\nat the pope ’s installation in 2013 , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , the spiritual leader of some 300 million orthodox christians worldwide , invited francis to jerusalem to mark the 50th anniversary of a historic meeting between their predecessors .\n“ it ’s hard to understand now what a breakthrough that meeting was , ” said the rev.\nalexander karloutsos , an eastern orthodox priest who is helping organize part of the pope 's trip .\nat the time , the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches , the world ’s two largest christian communities , were n’t even on speaking terms , said karloutsos .\nmarriages celebrated in one church would not be recognized by the other .\non sunday , francis and bartholomew will sign a joint declaration outlining common principles and a potential path forward to greater unity .\n“ these people do n’t sign things lightly , ” karloutsos said .\n“ this is a very substantial document .\n” francis and bartholomew also will celebrate a joint religious service at the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem on sunday , the first time the eastern orthodox and roman catholic leaders have held such a service in 50 years , according to karloutsos .\n3 .\nthe ‘ people ’s pope ’ will strike again he has celebrated masses for migrants who drowned while trying to sail to europe , visited brazil ’s most dangerous neighborhoods and welcomed homeless men in rome to his birthday party .\nin the holy land , pope francis is again expected to draw the world ’s attention to the poor and downtrodden and has refused to travel , as most leaders do in the middle east , in an armored car .\nin jordan , where some 600,000 syrians have fled since the start of the civil war in 2011 , the pope will meet refugees and disabled young people before delivering a speech at a church in bethany .\non the west bank , he will greet children from several palestinian refugee camps .\npalestinian archbishop atallah hanna , who is eastern orthodox ( as are most christians in the middle east ) said he hopes pope francis will “ see the suffering of the palestinian people .\n” “ we are misrepresented and are unfortunately seen by some to be criminals and terrorists , ” hanna said .\n“ i hope they can see that we are a civilized , peaceful and well-educated people seeking freedom and a better future .\n” john esposito , an expert on international relations at georgetown university , said the pope ’s meeting with christians in bethlehem could open some eyes about the israel-palestinian standoff .\n“ it will underscore the fact that it ’s not just a muslim-jewish conflict , ” he said .\n4 .\nconservative israelis are nervous .\nin the weeks before the pope ’s arrival , graffiti calling jesus “ garbage ” and calling for “ death to arabs and christians ” has been scrawled on christian buildings in jerusalem .\nultra-orthodox jews have planned to protest outside the site of the last supper - known as the cenacle - because it is also said to house king david ’s tomb .\nthey believe christians should not hold religious services , as pope francis plans to do on sunday , so close to a jewish holy site , and they worry that israel will turn the cenacle over to the vatican during the pope ’s visit , according to reports .\njerusalem 's five most contested sites on wednesday , israeli police issued restraining orders on several right-wing jewish activists , according to the new york times , ordering them to stay away from the pope during his visit .\nrabbi david rosen , international director for interreligious affairs at the american jewish congress , told cnn that the troublemakers are fringe figures who “ do n’t deserve anything like the attention they ’ve gotten .\n” “ the vast majority of israelis are looking forward to the pope ’s visit , if they ’re even aware of it yet , ” said rosen , who is in jerusalem to participate in papal events .\nthe rabbi said he is slightly chagrined , though , that francis will not hold an interfaith service with muslim and jewish leaders in jerusalem , as pope benedict xvi did in 2009 .\n“ i am personally disappointed that this opportunity to demonstrate in actions and not simply in words the possibility of bringing together christians , muslims and jews is not on his schedule .\n” the vatican says that , because the pope is traveling with rabbi skorka and sheikh abboud , the whole trip is essentially an interfaith gathering .\n5 .\nmuslims view francis as a welcome change .\npope benedict xvi did n’t have the best relationship with muslims , said georgetown 's esposito , who is traveling to jordan to meet with francis on saturday .\nthe former pope quoted anti-islamic remarks made by a 14th-century christian emperor in a speech in 2006 , leading to muslim riots .\nbenedict apologized , but later baptized a prominent muslim-born journalist , which some islamic leaders called an unnecessary provocation .\nin contrast , one of francis ’ first interfaith steps as pope was to wash the feet of two muslims during a holy thursday ceremony in 2013 , a move noted throughout the islamic world , esposito said .\n“ what popes do is as symbolically important as what they say , ” esposito said , “ and muslims have been very impressed with francis .\n” the pope also called on western nations to find a peaceful solution to syria ’s civil war , rather than use military force .\non this trip to the holy land , francis is expected to call for a palestinian state , which has long been vatican policy , but will surely upset some israelis .\nthat ca n't - please-both dilemma shows how hard it can be to navigate the holy land for any world leader , even one with the charisma and political acumen of francis .\nbringing a sheikh and rabbi along may help buffer the pope from some criticism , but ultimately , all eyes will be on the man in white .\n( cnn 's roba alhenawi contributed to this report . )\nthe cnn belief blog covers the faith angles of the day 's biggest stories , from breaking news to politics to entertainment , fostering a global conversation about the role of religion and belief in readers ' lives .\nit

{"document": "buffalo drafted a talented playmaker in c.j.\nspiller , but ignored needs at quarterback and offensive tackle to do so .\nmay is minicamp season in the nfl , which means hope and optimism are permeating the air as teams go about their work in shorts and helmets , confident improvement is well within reach , if not inevitable .\nbut we all know reality is coming , and sometimes it bites .\neven amid the happy talk that prevails in the spring , it 's often easy to see a storm clouds forming around a team from miles away ( think atlanta , circa 2007 , or the post-super bowl eagles in 2005 ) .\nbut sometimes trouble can slip up an organization , and a disappointing season can result from issues that only become obvious after it 's too late to fix them ( the surprising struggles of the 2009 titans and steelers come to mind ) .\nflash back to this time last year , and hopes were high everywhere as well .\nbut that make-or-break season that seemed to be on the horizon in buffalo ?\nwell , it broke , and the fissure opened even before the games started counting , with the bills firing offensive coordinator turk schonert in the preseason , just a few months before canning head coach dick jauron .\nthe tea leaves also read ominously for washington last may , and the predicted end of the jim zorn and jason campbell eras indeed eventually came to pass .\nin hindsight , the same can be said about the early and telling missteps committed by the new head coach-general manager tandems that went to work last year in kansas city and tampa bay ; sure enough , before the season was out , the chiefs and bucs had combined to win only slightly more games ( seven ) than the number of coordinators they had canned ( four ) .\nand do n't forget the first-year coaching and front-office struggles experienced by eric mangini and the browns and jim mora and the seahawks ; a lot of the losing that ensued in places like cleveland and seattle last year now looks utterly predictable .\nso which clubs seem headed for setbacks and disappointment in 2010 ?\nwith a pessimistic eye peeled toward the upcoming season , we measure the vibes emanating from around the nfl and take our best guess at the eight teams that have reason to worry in 2010 : reason to worry : go ahead .\ndissect the bills ' offseason and make the case that they 've closed a significant chunk of the gap that existed between them and the rest of the afc east .\ni dare you .\nthe jets went on a headline-name shopping spree ( antonio cromartie , ladainian tomlinson , santonio holmes ) , the dolphins reeled in karlos dansby and brandon marshall and the patriots tried to re-stock with five of the first 90 picks in this year 's deep draft .\nbuffalo , meanwhile , kept a low profile in free agency ( dwan edwards , cornell green , andra davis ) and made something of a luxury-item pick in the first round , drafting talented clemson running back c.j.\nspiller .\nreceiving considerably less attention were the fairly vital positions of quarterback and offensive tackle .\nit just looks like more of the same for the bills , who have been running in place for so long now that it 's hard to detect any motion at all .\nand this time around they do n't even have a terrell owens signing to whip up a little interest in an otherwise lackluster team .\nreason not to panic : new bills head coach chan gailey has made some good-but-not-great quarterbacks go a long way in the past , and kordell stewart , jay fiedler and tyler thigpen know it .\ngailey had a pretty solid record as an offensive coordinator for three teams , and he went two-for-two in taking the cowboys to the playoffs as a head coach in the late '90s .\nthe bills could be -- and have been -- in far worse hands .\nreason to worry : honest question : when 's the last time a true make-or-break year went the right way for a team ?\ni suppose you could say dallas and wade phillips fit the bill last season , although almost every year feels like it 's super bowl-or-bust for the cowboys .\nbut that 's what embattled head coach lovie smith , general manager jerry angelo and the bears are up against in 2010 : win enough to shoo the wolves away from their doors , or close out their windy city tenures with a fourth consecutive non-playoff season .\nworking under that kind of pressure rarely brings the best out of anyone , or results in smiles and backslaps all around .\nas if that 's not enough of an omen , the bears went out and dominated early in free agency this year , signing the likes of julius peppers and chester taylor .\nthere 's not really a long track record of pace-setting free-agent success leading to on-field success in the same year -- a lesson teams like washington , oakland and denver have learned the hard way .\nreason not to panic : the bears ( 7-9 ) were n't bad from start to finish last season .\nthey started 3-1 , and finished 3-2 .\nit was that 1-6 stretch in the middle that killed smith 's team .\non paper , peppers , taylor and offensive coordinator mike martz are all upgrades at their positions .\nand year 2 of the jay cutler era ca n't possibly be as much of a rollercoaster ride .\nreason to worry : it 's crystal clear from the comments made this offseason by both jaguars head coach jack del rio and owner wayne weaver that they will enter this season with something less than brimming confidence in starting quarterback david garrard .\nboth have challenged garrard to step up his game to an elite level , in part , no doubt , to justify the elite contract jacksonville gave him in 2008 .\ngarrard has acknowledged this is a crossroads season for him , but by almost anyone 's estimation he 's the fourth-best qb in the four-team afc south , and there 's even talk that backup luke mccown could push for the no.\n1 job in the preseason ( kind of the same way garrard beat out starter byron leftwich in 2007 ) .\nit 's hard to see where real improvement is supposed to come from in jacksonville , given the jaguars still do n't have enough receivers to make trouble for afc defenses .\nthey play in one of the deepest divisions in the game and their schedule this season happens to be the fifth-toughest in the nfl ( a .535 opponents ' winning percentage ) .\nlooking back , last year 's 7-9 mark might have represented overachievement .\nreason not to panic : the jaguars fielded a lot of young players on both sides of the ball last season , and that move might reap even bigger rewards in 2010 .\nit 's often said the biggest jump young players make in developing their game comes as they enter their second season , which would bode well for jacksonville offensive tackles eugene monroe and eben britton .\nthe jaguars also have a still-emerging star in receiver mike sims-walker .\nreason to worry : what are the feel-good , party-loving , defending super bowl champs doing on this list ?\nwell , if you 're talking about teams in prime position for a letdown , the prior season 's lombardi trophy winner is always a strong candidate .\nneed we remind you that there has only been one repeat champion in the past 11 nfl seasons ( 2003-2004 patriots ) , or that the steelers did n't even make it back to the playoffs last year after winning in 2008 ?\nthe saints are undoubtedly still loaded and should again be the class of the nfc south .\nbut there are factors that should make them wary .\nfor one , super bowl champs seem to consistently underestimate the impact of having the shortest offseason in the league , and in new orleans , where the victory parades seemed to roll on into march , that disadvantage might be even more acute this year .\nand then , of course , there 's the potential elephant in the room .\ni ca n't help but think it 's not a positive development to be dealing with the specter of new orleans coaches sean payton and joe vitt and general manager mickey loomis linked to a civil lawsuit and a dea investigation involving stolen vicodin from the team 's medicinal cabinet .\nif this story grows legs , it would represent the kind of first-class distraction that could blow up a season and derail any team 's plans .\nreason not to panic : check out the new orleans roster , then check out the nfc south .\nwith all that talent , and with the bucs and panthers unlikely to be making any playoff runs this season , atlanta is the only team capable of making the saints really work for another division title .", "summary": "may is minicamp season in the nfl , which means hope and optimism are

{"document": "washington ( cnn ) -- mitt romney seems to be undergoing an extreme makeover -- presidential candidate edition .\na few months ago he told donors at a florida fundraiser that he 'd never convince the 47 % of americans who he described as government-dependent shoo-ins for president barack obama to \" take personal responsibility and care for their lives . \"\nin the ensuing firestorm , he admitted his comments were \" not elegantly stated , \" but defended the main point of his message , saying he was criticizing the increasing size of government and entitlement programs .\non thursday during a fox news interview , he said he was wrong .\nromney on 47 % comments : i was ' completely wrong ' \" clearly in a campaign with hundreds if not thousands of speeches and question-and-answer sessions , now and then you 're going to say something that does n't come out right , \" romney said on fox news . \"\nin this case , i said something that 's just completely wrong . \"\nwhile romney 's shifting positions give opponents an opportunity to tag him with the \" flip-flop \" label , it 's not that unusual for a candidate to appeal to the party base in the primaries and then move toward the center as a general election nears .\nthe idea is to capture undecided voters , who generally are found in the middle , political experts say .\nduring the primaries , romney told crowds he 'd repeal financial regulations at the center of the dodd-frank wall street reform law .\nduring wednesday 's debate with obama , he said he 'd repeal and replace it .\nhe added that some parts of the measure \" make all the sense in the world . \"\nhe also campaigned during the primaries on repealing the health care overhaul law known as obamacare on day one of his presidency , and steered well clear of discussing a similar plan enacted during his tenure as governor of massachusetts .\nromney softened his position in recent weeks , saying there were some parts of obama 's plan that he 'd consider keeping .\nromney touted his state 's health care law during the debate and his plan to preserve coverage for preexisting medical conditions -- the type also found in the federal measure championed by obama .\nthe audacity of romney 's etch a sketch romney 's moderate tone and move to the middle is a traditional strategy employed by candidates during campaigns , political experts say .\nbut his shift is viewed more skeptically since senior adviser eric fehrnstrom told cnn earlier this year that the candidate could \" hit a reset button for the fall campaign .\n... it 's almost like an etch a sketch .\nyou can kind of shake it up , and we start all over again . \"\nromney 's initial challenge before securing the republican nomination was to convince conservative voters skeptical of his moderate political past that he could embrace their concerns , political experts say .\nthe situation , in many ways , reflects a split within the gop between strident conservatives on budget and social issues and more mainstream republicans . \"\nhe 's trapped between a rock and hard place , \" said david lowry , director of the center for american political responsiveness at pennsylvania state university .\nas a result , romney made the decision on the campaign trail to take a harder line .\nfor example , he selected rep. paul ryan as his running mate , bringing aboard a seasoned congressional lawmaker with sharp political instincts and social and fiscal credentials celebrated by the right .\nwhat 's next : can obama recover or will romney run up the score ?\nrunning as a hard line conservative has done little to net romney more support with voters overall , however , as polls remained tight .\nmoreover , in recent weeks , obama has opened up a lead in several critical swing states . \"\nin one sense you would expect presidential candidates who 've had to tact to one side or the other to go back ( to the other side ) .\nwhat was intriguing with the romney case is how far he felt he had to tact to the right , \" said andrew rudalevige , a political science professor at bowdoin college . \"\ni always wondered what would have happened if he ran on his massachusetts record which he touted during the debates . \"\nromney 's initial debate reviews this week were positive mainly due to the way he aggressively confronted obama in their first face-to-face meeting .\nbut there was a shift in tone and substance on key issues as well designed to resonate with key voter groups . \"\ni do think the obama campaign has a point when they say this is a different mitt romney who is not the tea party mitt romney , \" cnn senior political analyst david gergen said on anderson cooper 360 . \"\nthis was somebody who said there is a role for government .\nhe agreed with president obama on education to get those women voters on board .\nyou know , it was a different calibration . \"\nsome conservatives who had recently criticized romney 's campaign as lethargic and on the verge of losing the election hailed his apparent turnaround at the debate . \"\non wednesday night , romney finally emerged from the fog .\nhe broke with the stereotypes of his party and , at long last , began the process of offering a more authentic version of himself , \" conservative columnist david brooks wrote .\nconservative wall street journal columnist , peggy noonan , who eviscerated romney 's campaign as \" incompetent \" in a column last month , now says \" america got its first , sustained look at the good and competent mr. romney .\nand it really was a first . \"\nthe obama campaign is pouncing on this switch as an \" etch-a-sketch \" moment and accused romney of pandering for votes . \"\ni met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be mitt romney , \" obama said thursday on the campaign trail . \"\nbut it could n't have been mitt romney . \"\nthe president continued the theme on friday , telling a crowd at george mason university in northern virginia , \" my opponent , you know , has been trying to do a two-step and reposition and got an extreme makeover . \"\nobama faced similar criticism during the 2008 democratic primaries on positions that were left of then rival and current secretary of state hillary clinton .\nthis week , liberals are upset with obama for saying during the debate that he and

{"document": "the republican presidential front-runner proposed a sweeping redirection of america 's global role in a major speech , part of a string of planned addresses designed to flesh out what a trump administration would look like and to establish leadership credentials ahead of an increasingly probable general election clash with democrat and former secretary of state hillary clinton .\nthe billionaire businessman simultaneously addressed restive american voters and global elites worried by his fiery rhetoric on national security : he stressed that the united states would always put its economic and foreign policy interests first but said that allies in europe , asia and the middle east would benefit from a much stronger , less ambiguous u.s. role in the world -- as long as they were prepared to pay up . \"\namerica first will be the overriding theme of my administration , \" trump said in his remarks at washington 's mayflower hotel , delivered from a prepared text and in a subdued fashion starkly at odds with the free-wheeling rhetorical style that has powered his political rise on the campaign trail . \"\nunder a trump administration , no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries , \" trump said .\nhe added , \" my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security first . \"\nthe speech appeared to be a multi-pronged attempt to reach out to a host of important constituencies .\nfirst , he appealed to a republican foreign policy establishment that has been highly critical at points of his credentials on global national security policy .\nsecond , he tried to reach wavering republicans who may be excited by his harsh critique of the \" obama-clinton \" foreign policy .\nand third , he sought an affirmation to loyal supporters who have flocked to his \" make america great \" slogan amid claims that the united states is weak and not respected by its enemies or foes .\nhis remarks immediately elicited criticism from democrats , but some gop insiders offered positive words that have until now been in short supply for trump .\nhe spoke the morning after a sweep of five primary states that drew him markedly closer to the delegate total needed to claim the republican nomination and at a time when his campaign has begun a broad effort to cast him in a more presidential light .\nbut trump often lacked specifics , delivering little in the way of a recognizable foreign strategy and repeating many of his campaign trail declarations , and did not explain in detail how his ideas would be implemented or touch on the likely response from american allies and enemies to his sharp reorientation of u.s. global principles .\nin comments likely to cause shockwaves among u.s friends in europe and asia , trump previewed early attempts to cut deals with russia and china -- seen by many adversaries as bent on overthrowing the current security order guaranteed by america .\nif there was not a good deal to be had , trump warned , he would be prepared to walk away .\nbut he also said he would not rush to war , striking an isolationist note that contrasts with the last republican administration of george w. bush .\nhowever , trump was introduced by zalmay khalilzad , president george w. bush 's former ambassador to afghanistan , iraq and the permanent representative to the united nations . \"\ni will never send our finest into battle unless necessary , and i mean absolutely necessary , and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital v , \" trump emphasized .\ntrump opened his speech vowing to \" shake the rust off america 's foreign policy \" and said he would outline a vision for a u.s. foreign policy \" that replaces randomness with purpose , ideology with strategy and chaos with peace . \"\nthe billionaire then tore into obama 's foreign policy , panning the iran nuclear deal and claiming the president has \" weakened our military by weakening our economy . \"\nhe sought to wrap clinton in his criticism of the obama administration as well , referring to the \" legacy of the obama-clinton interventions \" as one of \" weakness , confusion and disarray . \"\nat the same time , he offered an olive branch of sorts to muslim allies of the united states in rare remarks pointing to the ways in which the u.s. can have constructive relations with the muslim world . \"\nwe 're going to be working very closely with our friends in the muslim world , which are all at risk for violent attacks , \" he said .\nhis comments on muslims and middle east partners have been lightning rods throughout the campaign .\ntrump had previously called for a temporary ban on muslim foreigners entering the united states and suggested that u.s. middle east allies need to shoulder more of the cost of american military involvement in the region .\nbut he added that these countries also need to acknowledge america 's contributions . \"\nthis has to be a two-way street , \" he said . \"\nthey must also be good to us .\nit 's no longer one way , it 's two way . \"\ntrump also put america 's allies elsewhere on notice that they , too , must start making a more tangible financial contribution .\nhe said he would call summits in europe and asia to discuss \" a rebalancing of commitments . \"\nhe previewed a substantial shift toward two of america 's most important global rivals , china and russia .\nhe vowed to reverse china 's \" assault on america 's jobs and wealth \" and to use america 's \" economic power \" over china to bring beijing into line .\nbut he also pledged to fix relations with the rising asian giant , saying that a stronger america would win more respect from its communist leaders .\nbut if that did n't work , trump said he would be prepared to walk away , without offering specifics on the economic and national security consequences that would entail . \"\nwe can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways .\nif need be , that 's what 's going to happen , \" he warned .\nretired adm. charles kubic , a member of trump 's national security advisory committee , conceded wednesday that many world leaders have been \" shaken \" by trump 's brash rhetoric and at-times radical policy positions . \"\nsometimes it 's hard when you believe a narrative for such a long time , and you have another narrative forced upon you .\nwhen somebody 's saying , ' no , we 're not going that direction , ' it 's very difficult to understand it , \" kubic told cnn .\nbut kubic said that while it might sound \" harsh \" at first when trump \" speaks the truth , \" it begins to make sense once you think about it more .\nreaction to trump 's speech from his political foes was swift and scathing .\nformer secretary of state madeleine albright , who supports clinton , described his comments as a \" simplistic \" mixture of slogans and contradictions . \"\nhe just underscored the fact that he is running the most reckless and dangerous presidential campaign in modern history , \" albright said on a clinton campaign conference call .\non the same call , democratic virginia sen. tim kaine said that the last thing the world needed was an \" unpredictable \" united states , saying allies needed to know they could count on washington and adversaries needed to understand there will consequences for acting against america .\ntrump 's main republican rival , texas sen. ted cruz , said the speech showed that trump \" fails the presidential test \" and pressured the billionaire to force any foreign policy advisers who have worked as lobbyists to declare their links to foreign governments .\nbut gop tennessee sen. bob corker , who chairs the senate foreign relations committee , praised the speech . \"\ntoday , donald trump delivered a very good foreign policy speech in which he laid out his vision for american engagement in the world , \"

francis on hot-button issues pope francis on hot-button issues editor 's note : kevin clarke is senior editor/chief correspondent at america magazine , a national news and culture weekly published by the jesuits .\n( cnn ) -- pope francis ignited a firestorm on the internet with a few words about gay and lesbian people that seemed to suggest a new church position on homosexuality .\ni say \" seemed to \" because it would only appear new to someone who was unfamiliar with the old position .\nspeaking to a gang of reporters bringing up the rear of his plane on the way home from his quotific visit to rio de janeiro , the pope was asked about his recent reference to a \" gay lobby \" among the curial staff in rome .\nthat phrase is already the source of some confusion .\nthe pope responded that although a \" gay lobby , \" as in an inter-curial pressure group -- for or against more acceptance of gay catholics , who can say ?\n-- might be an issue , he did not have a problem with men and women who are homosexual . \"\nif they accept the lord and have good will , who am i to judge them ?\nthey should n't be marginalized .\nthe tendency ( to homosexuality ) is not the problem ... they 're our brothers . \"\nspeaking about homosexuality so frankly was remarkable in and of itself , but nothing the pope said deviated from current catholic catechism .\nalthough it regards homosexual acts as \" intrinsically disordered , \" church teaching demands that gay and lesbian people be accepted with \" respect , compassion , and sensitivity . \"\n\" every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided , \" reads the catechism . \"\nthese persons are called to fulfill god 's will in their lives and , if they are christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the lord 's cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . \"\nthe catechism is a little more nuanced , and less unsightly , than the standard \" hate the sin , love the sinner \" platitude , but it does n't say much more and it 's far less than most lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender catholics would like to hear from their church .\npope francis was merely reiterating this teaching in his wonderfully straightforward , cut-through-the-gobbledygook manner .\nthat 's not to say that his remarks do n't suggest a different emphasis in the church 's tone and pastoral approach to gay and lesbian catholics that will surely be welcome .\nfrancis places the emphasis first on solidarity ( \" they 're our brothers \" ) and refers to the redemption and mercy all of us require and are capable of achieving .\nand as a practical ecclesiastical matter , his comments also argue that the \" duty \" to discourage the vocations of men with \" deep-seated homosexual tendencies \" may be en route to the \" do n't ask , do n't tell \" historical rag and bone shop .\nother groups of disaffected catholics can also take heart from the pope 's unfiltered comments on the plane .\nhe suggested that his cardinal action squad of curial reformers will also be looking at the way the church has treated catholics who , for whatever reason , could not annul their marriages .\ndivorced and remarried catholics have long been cut off from the sacramental and communal life of the church .\nfrancis clearly wants to find a way to bring them home .\nwomen can also be hopeful that francis hears their lamentations regarding how they have been cut off from leadership roles in the church .\nalthough he suggested that he had little inclination to return to the issue of women 's ordination , he said the church still has far to go in developing a real theology that explains the importance of women in the church .\nwhat that means practically speaking remains to be seen .\nlet 's hope that what does not become lost as his comments on homosexuality are parsed , turned over and otherwise manhandled by the media in the coming days , is the pope 's keen attention during his world youth day visit to issues of economic injustice and the importance of political and social dialogue .\nasked why he did not spend so much time on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage while in rio , he said the church 's teaching on such matters are already clear .\nthis pope may be interested in moving at least rhetorically away from cultural stalemates and on to other issues that have also long been a preoccupation of the church : fighting poverty and human deprivation , creating political and economic opportunity , the just and sustainable stewardship of creation .\nin rio he spoke frequently on social justice and alleviating poverty , asking all to give of their talents to respond to the world 's aching needs in a country where those needs and inequities are obvious .\nin rio , francis expressed his hope for a \" culture of encounter , \" as he described it .\nthat 's an encounter across gay and straight lines , political and class lines , self-drawn lines between secularists and the faithful , borders between the haves and have-nots .\nas important as his off-the-cuff comments on the plane were -- and might turn out to be in the future -- his message of

{"document": "washington ( cnn ) -- republicans woke up sunday to a wave of new polls that showed their senate candidates surging ahead in key states -- including one in iowa that looked particularly grim for democrats -- giving the gop a jolt of enthusiasm going into the 2014 campaign cycle 's final hours .\ntwo days from the midterm election , washington 's political class was buzzing around news that iowa gop senate hopeful joni ernst was 7 percentage points up in a des moines register poll , and republican candidates and surrogates popped up on the sunday news shows , gleeful about their prospects . \"\ni think the wind is at our back , \" kentucky sen. rand paul said on cnn 's \" state of the union . \"\nhe added that republicans will \" in all likelihood \" win control of the senate and added : \" i think people are ready for new leadership . \"\nfueling the republicans ' optimism was a register poll that showed ernst leading democrat bruce braley , 51 % to 44 % -- prompting pollster j. ann selzer to tell the newspaper that \" this race looks like it 's decided . \"\nhours before the poll 's release , senate majority leader harry reid spelled out what a loss in the hawkeye state would mean for democrats . \"\niowa is critical .\nthere 's no other way to say it , \" reid said saturday in a conference call with the progressive change campaign committee . \"\njoni ernst would mean — coming to the united states senate — that mitch mcconnell would be leader of the united states senate , who agrees with her on everything , \" he said , according to politico .\nand it was n't just iowa that had good news for republicans .\na new set of nbc news/marist polls unveiled sunday morning gave republicans boosts in three key senate races -- including mcconnell 's in kentucky , as well as georgia , where democrats had hoped to pickup a seat , and louisiana , where democratic sen. mary landrieu is in a tough race for her political career .\nthose incumbent senate democrats have spent the fall trying to distance themselves from president barack obama , whose floundering state-level approval ratings have been a drag for his party down the ticket as republicans tie their opponents to the commander-in-chief every chance they get . \"\nthis is really the last chance for america to pass judgment on the obama administration and its policies , \" former gop presidential nominee mitt romney said on \" fox news sunday . \"\nof course , polls are no guarantee for how elections will turn out on tuesday , as the past several elections for midterms and the presidential race were dogged by major network surveys that turned out to be very different from the actual results .\nand democrats cite the 2010 example of colorado where republican ken buck was consistently polling ahead in the final weeks of that race , only to be defeated by now sen. michael bennet . \"\nthis is really the last chance for america to pass judgment on the obama administration and its policies . \"\nmitt romney , former republican presidential candidate democrats swung back on the sunday shows as well to make the case that their early voting numbers suggest they 'll hold onto some of those seats .\ndemocratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz said on abc 's \" this week \" that her party 's candidates will benefit from get-out-the-vote efforts targeting people who supported obama in 2008 and 2012 , but did n't vote in the 2010 midterm elections . \"\nwe have a ground game that i know [ rnc chairman ] reince [ priebus ] would take ours over theirs any day of the week , \" she said .\nshe also pointed to democratic surrogates -- including former president bill clinton and secretary of state hillary clinton , obama and vice president joe biden -- and said they trounce gop surrogates like new jersey gov.\nchris christie , paul and texas sen. ted cruz .\nbut priebus shot back that \" our ground game is whipping their ground game . \"\n\" look , if americans who want change vote on tuesday , the democrats are going to have a terrible night .\nwe 're going to have a great night , \" he said . \"\nand it 's because barack obama 's policies and debbie wasserman schultz 's policies and harry reid 's policies are on the ballot . \"\nthe gop needs to pick up six seats to win a senate majority , and with several other victories all but guaranteed , losses in swing states like iowa could seal democrats ' fate .\nsenate republican leader mcconnell is ahead of democratic challenger alison lundergan grimes , 50 % to 41 % , according to an nbc news/marist survey released sunday .\ndemocrats had hoped the contest would be among their few chances to pick off a gop-held seat or at least divert resources from other key senate races .\nanother of those targets is georgia , but the republican nominee there , david perdue , has jumped to a 48 % to 44 % lead over democrat michelle nunn , the nbc news/marist survey found .\nthat lead might not be enough to clench that race .\nto win in georgia , candidates must earn more than 50 % of the vote -- and if neither perdue nor nunn are able to reach that mark , they 'd face each other again in a run-off election in january .\nin louisiana , democratic sen. mary landrieu is in trouble , too .\nthe nbc news/marist poll found her at 44 % support , but in the state 's \" jungle primary \" she 's facing two republicans -- rep. bill cassidy and tea party candidate rob maness .\nif landrieu falls short of 50 % , she 'd face just one of those republicans in a december run-off -- and without conservatives ' votes being split , she 'd be the underdog .\nthe gop is all but certain to win seats now held by retiring democrats in montana , south dakota and west virginia .\nthey 're also favored in alaska , arkansas and louisiana -- states consistently won by republican presidential candidates .\nwins in swing state targets like iowa , colorado , north carolina and new hampshire would offer a huge boost to republicans ' chances -- and would insulate the party from potential losses in georgia and kansas , where independent challenger greg orman has n't said who he 'd caucus with and therefore ca n't be considered a reliable supporter of either party .\ntop democrats , trying to narrow the gap , hit the trail sunday , including bill clinton , who planned four stops in arkansas -- where democratic sen. mark pryor is endangered and long-time clinton foil asa hutchinson is expected to win the governor 's race . \"\nlook , if americans who want change vote on tuesday , the democrats are going to have a terrible night .\nwe 're going to have a great night . \"\nreince priebus , republican national committee chairman hillary clinton , meanwhile , was in new hampshire , where sen. jeanne shaheen and gov.\nmaggie hassan are both facing stiff challenges in their re-election bids .\nshe 'll also attend the funeral for long-time boston mayor tom menino .\nobama , who 's stayed away from most senate races this year with the rare exception of a saturday visit to michigan on behalf of democratic candidate gary peters ,

of these companies boasted the bbb 's coveted a + rating when cnnmoney started investigating the bbb 's rating system earlier this year .\n( soon after cnnmoney inquired about these grades to the bbb , all but one were changed ) .\nand this group is joined by other questionable businesses , many of which pay thousands of dollars to the bbb each year for membership .\nsome even have founders or former ceos facing years behind bars .\nmeanwhile , respected fortune 500 companies , like microsoft and starbucks , do n't pay the organization 's membership fees and are among the bbb 's lowest-rated companies .\nthrough its investigation , cnnmoney found a sampling of more than 100 businesses that had ratings of a - or higher despite having serious actions taken against them by government regulators in the past year .\nsome have been ruled flat-out scams and were shut down , but still kept their high bbb grade .\nsome have already been required to pay multimillion dollar penalties .\nand others have recently been rocked by big government lawsuits .\ntake hcr manorcare , a paying bbb member which operates hundreds of nursing homes across the country , and has an a + rating .\nfederal prosecutors claim the company bilked medicare out of millions of dollars by repeatedly providing therapy to patients that was n't medically necessary -- and in some cases , potentially harmful to patients .\none of the patients highlighted in the government lawsuit : an 84-year-old man who was immediately subjected to intensive physical , occupational and speech therapy upon being admitted to one of the company 's illinois facilities .\nafter a month , he was barely eating and told the nurses that he \" hurt all over . \"\neven when his doctor ordered the therapy to stop , he was put into a group session the same day -- where therapists noted in his chart that he was n't breathing properly and was n't speaking .\nhe died approximately five days later .\nthe government lawsuit is ongoing , and hcr manorcare denies the allegations .\nwhen asked about its bbb rating , hcr manorcare said that \" the bbb has set criteria that our facilities have met . \"\nbut meeting these \" criteria \" does n't always mean much .\nthrough its investigation into the organization and its practices , cnnmoney found that the bbb 's rating system is seriously flawed -- resulting in grades that appear to be arbitrary and change erratically .\nand it 's not just paying members that receive high ratings even though they are facing government actions -- non-member businesses were also on cnnmoney 's list .\nbut the bbb claims to keep a closer eye on its paying members , holding them to a higher standard .\nin many cases , more weight is placed on companies addressing complaints through the bbb 's own system than any other factor -- even government lawsuits alleging practices that directly violate the bbb 's principles of membership like misleading advertising .\nmeanwhile , consumer lawsuits are n't factored into grades at all , no matter how many there are against a single company .\nand when it comes to government actions , the bbb sometimes deems a penalty so minor that a company can still maintain its a rating .\nmilitary credit services of norfolk , virginia , for example , recently settled government charges that it went after service members with illegal debt collection lawsuits .\nthe bbb clearly acknowledges on its website that the company 's settlement -- which required military credit services and two other companies to refund $ 2.7 million to thousands of borrowers hit with these lawsuits -- has been factored into the company 's grade .\nbut even with this black mark military credit services , a paying bbb member , still boasts an a - .\nvirginia attorney general mark herring , who prosecuted the case against military credit services along with federal regulators , told cnn that he thinks the bbb \" may want to take a second look \" at the company 's high rating .\nin other cases , government actions do n't appear to be factored into the grade at all -- possibly because the bbb is n't aware of them .\nand in cases where the action is still pending , the bbb often leaves the grade untouched and notes that no wrongdoing has been proven .\nthe organization also acknowledges that grades are based on the information it has at the time -- making it extremely difficult to provide accurate ratings for more than 4 million companies nationwide .\nrelated : how the better business bureau rakes in millions here 's how this massive ratings machine works : the bbb rates companies ranging from small town plumbers to wall street banks .\nnearly 400,000 of these businesses are paying members -- which the bbb relies on for the majority of its revenue .\nin 2013 , the organization 's revenue totaled nearly $ 200 million among all of its bureaus , according to tax forms analyzed by cnnmoney .\nthe organization says that trustworthy companies can become bbb \" accredited , \" which can cost anywhere from hundreds to more than $ 10,000 in membership fees each year .\nbut not every business is eligible -- before granting membership , the bbb says it does extensive research and has a laundry list of requirements that prospective members must meet , like responding to all consumer complaints , advertising honestly and maintaining at least a b rating .\nit says that grades are calculated using more than a dozen factors , including the type of company , length of time in business and complaint volume in relation to its size . \"\naccredited businesses have a special responsibility to maintain the ratings they 've earned , \" bbb council president mary power said in a written statement , after declining to be interviewed in person . \"\nthis ensures that bbb ratings are consistent with our goals as an organization : to flag substandard behavior , but also to encourage businesses to adopt best practices and earn better grades . \"\nin return , members get to flaunt their membership with the bbb , use its name and logo in advertising and gain access to free dispute resolution services .\nwhile many people view the bbb as a consumer watchdog or even a government agency , the bbb itself says this is a misconception .\ninstead , it views itself as a mediator between frustrated consumers and the companies they do business with , receiving nearly 1 million complaints each year from consumers hoping to achieve resolutions like refunds and repairs .\nthese complaints are handled by more than 100 independent bureaus across the country , which are overseen by the national council of better business bureaus .\nthe bbb touts its work with law enforcement agencies to shut down fraudulent companies and insists that money has nothing to do with the grades it gives to paying members .\nit says that both paying and non-paying companies can and do earn a + ratings .\nit is also proud of the complex algorithm it uses to grade companies -- the inner workings of which it closely guards .\nwhile some businesses likely deserve their bad ratings and others are worthy of their a grades , even the bbb will admit its rating process is n't perfect .\nit says that its ratings are not endorsements and that they do n't mean that a business ' products or services have been evaluated .\ninstead , the organization told cnnmoney in a written statement that the ratings represent the \" bbb 's opinion about a business 's trustworthiness and how it is likely to interact with its customers . \"\nyet , millions of american consumers are counting on them to be reliable and reputations of businesses all over the country are depending on them .\nlast year alone , company ratings were viewed on the bbb website more than 165 million times -- a 25 % jump from 2013 .\nmichigan resident christopher dipiero says he chose jack 's wholesale windows & design to replace the windows in his michigan home five years ago based on its a rating from the bbb .\nbut he claims the $ 5,000 job turned into a nightmare when the new windows he ordered were too small and improperly installed .\ndipiero says jack 's refused to replace them so he turned to the bbb .\nafter months of asking for help through the bbb 's online complaint process with no success , he sued the company and ended up winning a more than $ 20,000 judgment ( including attorney 's fees ) , in part because the judge found that jack 's had broken a federal warranty law .\nhe notified the bbb about the ruling but says the organization still did nothing to help or warn other consumers by including the ruling against jack 's on its website or factoring it into its grade .\nso dipiero turned around and sued the bbb itself , alleging that the nonprofit violated consumer protection laws by allowing paying members to retain membership and high grades even when they broke the organization 's own rules .\nbut judges threw out his case because no consumer transaction took place between dipiero and the bbb , and the state supreme court declined to hear the case . \"\nthe better business bureau is 100 % a fraud , \" said dipiero . \"\nthey 're not doing what they 're saying they 're doing in terms of making sure these businesses are credible . \"\nthe owner of jack 's , jack tilka , blamed a personnel issue and said he regrets that jack 's did n't do more to resolve dipiero 's grievances sooner .\nbut he says he tried to offer dipiero a full refund during court proceedings .\nthe bbb has come under fire for allegations of unfair ratings and unethical practices in the past .\nin 2010 , the connecticut attorney general likened its membership program to a \" pay to play \" scheme after a local bureau gave an annual award for business ethics to a company that was under investigation by his office .\nwhen the organization vowed to address the issues , which included eliminating a policy that barred non-members from earning a + ratings , he backed down .\naround the same time , the bbb 's biggest bureau in los angeles was accused of selling its top ratings .\na 20/20 investigation documented how a group of business owners who were convinced the bbb 's rating system was unfair was able to secure an a - rating for a phony business named after the militant group hamas .\nnearly three years later , the national council shut down the l.a. bureau entirely , and called it an isolated incident .\nthe bureau has not been reopened .\nmost recently , the tulsa bbb fired its chief operating officer and is currently suing him over allegations he embezzled more than $ 1 million from the organization during his 16-year tenure , which included more than a decade as ceo .\nin the lawsuit it filed in june , the bbb claims he illegally used the nonprofit 's funds to pay for personal expenses -- including his mortgage , pool cleaner , credit card bills and \" to support a hidden gambling habit . \"\nwhile not all bureaus have had such scandals , cnnmoney analyzed hundreds of complaints filed with state attorneys general across the country and interviewed dozens of consumers and business owners who have their own problems with the organization .\nlike the pinball machine salesman who says his rating fell to an f after he canceled his bbb membership and says the organization is like \" a mobster telling me to pay . \"\nor the california homeowner who says that he 's complained about nightmare experiences with two contractors to the bbb , but in both cases the organization sided with the companies , which were paying members . \"\nconsumers should not trust a high grade from the bbb , \" joseph ridout a spokesperson for watchdog group consumer action , told cnn . \"\nthere are too many examples of companies that have been investigated or sued by government entities that nonetheless can maintain ratings of a high a or a + . \"\neven if the bbb wants it to be fair , the ratings system is broken .\nit 's easier for paying members to resolve complaints in order to keep their bbb accreditation and stamp of approval , paying companies must resolve all complaints -- one of the most heavily-weighted factors that goes into a company 's rating .\nthe bbb says complaints are deemed resolved if a company addresses the issue or makes a \" good faith \" effort .\nyet many member businesses are able to close complaints with generic letters and responses that consumers say clearly do n't address their problem , while some non-members struggle to resolve complaints at all , cnnmoney found .\nfor businesses with thousands of employees , basic bbb membership can cost more than $ 10,000 a year , according to bbb fee schedules .\nthis is often just a drop in the bucket for a major national company .\nit 's an entirely different story for small businesses , for whom membership fees start at around $ 400 a year and can climb into the thousands for companies with more than 100 employees .\nsheri kok , the owner of a small family pest control business in san diego , says her company 's a + rating plummeted to an f all because of a single customer complaint about her gopher extermination services , which she says she was never notified about .\nwhile there 's no way to know whether she lost business due to the f rating , she believes it cost her customers and hurt her reputation .\nthe bbb says that they always attempt to notify all businesses of complaints .\nbut kok says the complaint about her company was sent to an old address and nearly three years passed before she learned of it and realized her rating had dropped . \"\ni was thoroughly disgusted with them , \" said kok .\nin contrast , cnnmoney found multiple examples of the bbb taking extra steps to notify its paying members of complaints --- sending multiple letters , calling the businesses and even using certified mail to ensure they were received .\neven for non-members who are notified of complaints , it can be nearly impossible to get them resolved -- which is a major factor affecting a company 's bbb rating .\none business complained to the florida attorney general that he repeatedly tried to resolve a few complaints but could n't even log into the bbb 's computer system -- despite notifying the bbb about the issue .\nmeanwhile , a yacht salesman said his company 's rating was destroyed by a complaint against a completely different company .\nand a marine surveyor , whose business was plagued by an unresolved complaint , says bbb salespeople told him it would be easier to address the issue if he was a paying member .\ngrades on the bbb 's website can fluctuate wildly on a regular basis , making it impossible for consumers to get a reliable reading on a company .\nwhen cnnmoney started looking into the bbb earlier this year , for example , pepsi had a d. weeks later , its grade had jumped to an a + .\ngoogle 's grade , meanwhile , has been on a rollercoaster -- changing from a c - to an a - within weeks , and plummeting to an f by the time of publishing .\nand a couple of weeks after cnnmoney asked both the bbb and hsbc about the bank 's f rating , the grade was removed and changed to a \" no rating . \"\nat the time of publishing , the grade had jumped to an a + .\na number of factors can cause big changes in grades , according to the organization .\nif a company quickly resolves a pile of complaints , its rating can improve immediately .\nif a government action is taken against a business that the bbb deems serious enough , a rating can plummet .\nthe bbb told cnnmoney that its rating system is \" dynamic \" and that newer complaints and recent government actions have a bigger impact on a grade and these black marks drop off entirely after three years -- which can also suddenly boost a grade .\nbut some swings in ratings are more questionable than others .\nthe bbb would n't comment on cnnmoney 's findings and a spokeswoman noted that the more than 100 a-rated companies slammed by government regulators represent a fraction of the millions that the organization rates .\nyet many of these companies had their a ratings changed soon after cnnmoney asked the bbb about them .\nof the roughly 30 companies the bbb was asked by cnnmoney to comment on , the vast majority have since had their pages altered : some have had alerts about government actions added , and more than a dozen had their grade lowered or removed entirely .\namerifreight , for example , had an a + grade despite being charged by the ftc with allegedly failing to disclose to customers that it was paying for positive online reviews .\nat the time of publishing , the car shipment company had an a - and a red alert on its page warning of the government settlement .\nmeanwhile consumer manufacturing company fiskars brands had its grade slashed from an a + to a c + ( at the time of publishing , it had risen to a b - ) .\nlast year , the company settled charges that it failed to alert government regulators when axes sold by one of its divisions malfunctioned , causing serious injuries including lacerations that required stitches and caused permanent nerve damage .\nbut the bbb only updated its grade and added a notice about the government action after cnnmoney questioned its high grade .\nand when you visit the bbb 's web site and try to look up rapid tax 1 , a tax firm that was shut down by the doj this year for preying on low-income taxpayers and filing fraudulent tax returns , a \" 404 page not found \" message appears .\na page for the tax firm 's other location has fluctuated between a b + and an a - .\neven more confusing : one of the companies that many bbb offices have hired for marketing services , bold staffing , had an f rating up until cnnmoney inquired about it to both bold and the bbb .\nthat grade then disappeared and was replaced with a \" no rating . \"\nyou might think it would matter to the bbb that a customer has filed a lawsuit against a company alleging wrongdoing .\nbut that 's actually not the case .\nif a consumer filing a complaint with the bbb has also sued the company , the bbb completely backs off -- even if the lawsuit is decided in the consumer 's favor .\nand no matter how many lawsuits customers have filed against a company , it will have no bearing on its letter grade .\nthis may sound crazy since legal judgments against a company can be a sign of serious trouble .\nbut the bbb tells consumers it ca n't help them hash out a problem once it has been escalated to court and that the grade may be negatively affected by the same issues . \"\nbusiness behavior that prompts a lawsuit is often evident in a pattern of bbb complaints , which would impact the rating , \" the bbb said in a statement .\nbut the policy leaves many consumers frustrated and confused . \"\n[ the bbb is n't ] here to protect the consumer , \" said missouri resident joel brotherton , whose complaint about an electrical company was thrown out after the business told the bbb it was planning to sue brotherton over their payment dispute . \"\nthey 're here

{"document": "cincinnati , ohio ( cnn ) -- barack obama and mitt romney resumed campaigning monday , with both men focusing on the economy as key to their chances of winning the votes of americans in november .\nobama told supporters in cincinnati that he entered office four years ago seeking to restore \" the basic bargain that made america the greatest nation on earth . \"\nhe cited the idea that \" if you work hard , then you can get ahead ; if you 're responsible , then you can live out your dreams .\nyou 're not confined to the circumstances of your birth . \"\nromney , meanwhile , said in a tv interview that \" in my opinion , the issue people care about is who can get the american economy going again to help people have a brighter future , with rising wages and more capacity to care for their kids and to know that their kids will get good jobs when they come out of school . \"\nthat 's what this campaign is about , \" the presumptive gop nominee said on \" fox & friends . \"\nobama said he entered office at a time that the american dream \" was slipping away from too many people \" and that \" incomes and wages were flat-lining while the cost of everything -- from college to health care to groceries to gas -- were all going up . \"\nhe said his goal has been to reclaim that dream , but that he recognized when he became president that \" it might take more than one term , maybe more than one president \" to do so .\nspeaking from new hampshire , romney focused on obama 's performance in office and found it wanting : \" there are 23 million people that are out of work and ( who have ) stopped looking for work , \" he said . \"\nmedian income has dropped 10 % over the last four years .\nthe american people know whether things are better now than they were four years ago ... he ( obama ) just has n't been able to do the job he told us he was going to try to do . \"\nbut obama sought to deflect the blame and appealed to his audience for support . \"\nthe problem is that we 've got a stalemate right now in washington , \" he said . \"\nthis election is about more than just two candidates or political parties .\nit 's about two different visions about how do we build a strong economy .\nthe good news is you 're the tie-breaker .\nthe choice is up to you . \"\nobama also cited a new report that estimates that romney 's support for eliminating u.s. taxes on american companies ' foreign incomes would create an incentive for u.s. companies to move more of their jobs overseas .\ngergen : facts do n't support obama 's claims \" we have not found any serious economic study that says governor romney 's economic plan would actually create jobs until today , \" obama said . \"\ni 've got to be honest , today we found out there 's a new study out by nonpartisan economists that says governor romney 's economic plan would , in fact , create 800,000 jobs .\nthere 's only one problem .\nthe jobs would n't be in america . \"\nthe romney campaign quickly fired back . \"\npresident obama is at it again today with another dishonest attack meant to distract from his own record of failure , \" romney campaign spokeswoman amanda henneberg told cnn . \"\nafter spending three years pushing policies that drive jobs overseas and sending taxpayer money to foreign-owned companies , it 's clear president obama does n't have a clue when it comes to job creation in america . \"\nthe u.s. corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrial world , which hurts the ability of american businesses to compete globally and to create jobs in the united states , she said . \"\nmitt romney has a comprehensive plan to reform the corporate tax code that will lower rates , get rid of incentives for firms to create jobs in other countries , and encourage the kind of economic growth president obama has been unable to deliver , \" she added .\nthe new back-and-forth came as both campaigns have repeatedly accused the opposing candidate of outsourcing u.s. jobs overseas .\non another topic , romney defended his release of his 2010 tax return and the promised release of his 2011 return as sufficient , despite calls from critics that he make public earlier returns . \"\njohn mccain ran for president and released two years of tax returns , \" the former ceo of bain capital said of the 2008 gop candidate . \"\nthe obama people keep on wanting more and more and more , more things to pick through , more things for their opposition research to try to make a mountain out of and to distort and to be dishonest about . \"\nfrum : romney 's painfully bad week that stance is largely consistent with romney 's position during his 2002 campaign for massachusetts governor .\nromney 's democratic rival that year , shannon o'brien , released her tax information and called on romney to do the same . \"\npeople who run for public office are exposed to extraordinary scrutiny , and that 's as it should be , but there are some things that are not required for release , that are private , and i think my own income taxes , and my net worth and so forth are things i 'd like to keep between myself and my family , \" romney said in may 2002 , according to the boston herald .\nhis longtime strategist eric fehrnstrom cited the family 's \" privacy \" and noted that state law did not require candidates to provide anything more than a financial disclosure form filed with the state ethics commission .\non sunday , obama 's senior campaign adviser david axelrod told cnn 's \" state of the union \" such limited disclosure only raised more questions about romney 's finances . \"\ni can only conclude , with all these republicans asking him to release these returns , that whatever is in those returns would be more damaging to his campaign than simply not releasing them , \" axelrod said .\nsome republicans began pushing romney to release tax information over the weekend , saying it would be politically savvy to release the information to avoid a drawn-out fight with democrats . \"\nhe should release the tax returns tomorrow .\nit 's crazy , \" conservative columnist bill kristol said on \" fox news sunday . \"\n\" you got ta release six , eight , 10 years of back tax returns .\ntake the hit for a day or two . \"\nall of this , romney said monday , was a distraction from the real issues of the campaign .\nhe said his own campaign was happy to compare itself with obama 's administration on transparency , citing the president 's use of executive privilege to withhold documents related to the botched \" fast and furious \" program . \"\nthe administration has shown a serious departure from the transparency from which they suggested we had , \" romney said . \"\nand the american people should be calling for that kind transparency . \"\nfamilies object to 9/11 memorial 's ban on politicians gop sen. rob portman defended romney against obama 's \" personal \" attacks , saying the democrat was focusing on romney because his own record falls short .\nportman , speaking in lebanon , ohio , was holding an event for romney roughly two hours ahead of obama 's own campaign speech in nearby cincinnati . \"\nhe 's attacking mitt romney on a personal basis .\nwhy ?\nbecause he does n't want to talk about his record , \" the republican from ohio said .\nportman is widely speculated to be a potential vice-presidential pick for mitt romney .\nlast week portman said he met with romney campaign staffers during three meetings while in boston to headline a couple of fund-raisers for the presumptive republican presidential nominee .\nbut portman , a former congressman and cabinet member in the george w. bush administration , said the meetings were not at the romney campaign headquarters , and had nothing to do with the vice presidential vetting process .\non monday , he refused to speculate on the vice presidential selection process , nor would he say whether romney had made up his mind on his running mate .\nportman added , \" people vote for the presidential candidate , not the vice president . \"\nanother potential vice presidential pick said monday he had spoken with the romney aides involved in the search .\nsen. john thune of south dakota told the hill that he had traveled to boston to meet with beth myers , who is leading romney 's search for a vice presidential pick , along with other senior advisers at the presumptive gop nominee 's headquarters .\nthune would not say whether he was being formally vetted by romney 's team .\nthune would provide geographic balance on a potential republican ticket , though he would not offer a large degree of ideological disparity with the likely gop nominee .\nthune decided against making his own presidential bid in february 2011 , but is considered a gop hero for toppling incumbent tom daschle , then the top democrat in the senate , in 2004 .\nthune chairs the senate republican conference , which controls the party 's message in the senate , and is often mentioned as a presidential contender down the road .\nalso monday , restore our future , the super pac backing romney , announced it had brought in $ 20 million in june .\nthat marks a major jump from the prior month , when restore our future reported bringing in $ 4.6 million .\nthe spike was not a surprise , however , since the group received a $ 10 million donation from nevada casino mogul sheldon adelson and his wife , miriam , in june .\nalso helping the group was the first donation from foster friess , a millionaire who backed the pro-rick santorum super pac .\nhe told cnn he gave a six-figure donation to restore our future last month , though he refused to give the exact amount .\nrestore our future was active during the gop primary , spending $ 38.9 million in the first three months of 2012 .\nmuch of its money went to campaign television commercials in support of romney and critical of his rivals for the republican presidential nomination .", "summary": "barack obama and mitt romney resumed campaigning monday , with both men focusing on the economy as key to their chances of winning in november ."}

{"document": "washington ( cnn ) - it 's conventional wisdom : americans do n't like congress .\nbut when it comes time to vote , they usually do n't throw their lawmaker out of office .\nhowever , new polls indicate that times and perceptions about \" throwing the bums out \" may be changing .\nthose same surveys , as well as a veteran political handicapper , also suggest that one year before the 2014 midterm elections , the shutdown may provide the democrats an opportunity to win back the house .\nthe public is clearly angry over the two week-long partial federal government shutdown and how the talks to avert or end the shutdown and extend the nation 's debt limit have been handled .\nand while polls suggest that more of the blame has been pointed at the republicans in congress rather than their democratic counterparts or president barack obama , all sides are feeling the pain .\nas history proves , house incumbents overwhelmingly get re-elected , even in wave years .\nninety-four percent of incumbents won in 2006 , when democrats re-took both houses of congress .\nand 85 % of incumbents won a return trip to capitol hill in 2010 , when the gop , thanks to a 63 seat pickup , took back control of the house .\n( turnover in open seats where no incumbent was running accounted for the rest . )\nbut two new polls suggest that high retention rate could fall a bit in 2014 .\nwhile nearly three-quarters of registered voters questioned in a pew research center poll released tuesday said they would like to see most members of congress defeated in the next election , there was an even more eye popping number : thirty-eight percent said they did n't want their own representative re-elected .\nthat 's the highest level recorded in the more than two decades that pew has been asking that question . \"\nat this stage in the 2010 and 2006 midterms , fewer wanted to see their own member of congress defeated ( 29 % in november 2009 , 25 % in september 2005 ) , \" according to a release from pew research .\nthe pew poll is n't alone in finding a rise in voter dissatisfaction with their own representatives .\nsixty percent of people questioned in an nbc news/wall street journal survey released last thursday said if given the chance to vote to defeat and replace every single member of congress , including their own representative , they would .\nthat 's the highest level ever recorded on that question in nbc news/wall street journal polling . \"\nthese polls show a strong anti-incumbent mood , but you have to remember that most incumbents represent relatively safe districts due to gerrymandering and will probably have a major cash advantage and few of them are likely to draw strong challengers , \" said cnn polling director keating holland .\nthe nbc news/wall street journal poll , as well as handful of other national surveys conducted since the start of the shutdown on october 1 , indicate the gop brand taking a hit , with the party 's favorable ratings and the approval ratings for congressional republicans at or near historic lows .\nthose numbers seem to be affecting the generic ballot , which asks if you would vote for the democratic or republican candidate in your congressional district without mentioning the names of any candidates .\nthe democrats have an eight point advantage , 47 % -39 % , over the gop in the nbc news/wall street journal survey , a five point jump in a month .\nthe democrats were up nine points ( 43 % -34 % ) in a quinnipiac university survey conducted in the days just before the shutdown started , a five point increase since their previous poll in july .\nand the democrats have a six-point advantage over the gop in the pew poll . \"\nan anti-incumbent mood tends to hurt the party that has more incumbents , \" added holland \" that would suggest that 2014 might be a bad year for republicans , although with a democrat in the white house , the anti-incumbent mood could be muddled . \"\nthe new polling also has a top non-partisan political handicapper changing his mind . \"\nlast week i observed that i had n't yet seen ' compelling evidence ' that a democratic political wave could be developing .\ni can no longer say that after seeing the recently released nbc news/wall street journal poll , \" stuart rothenberg , editor and publisher of the non-partisan rothenberg political report , said wednesday .\nbut the next election is still more than a year away .\nat this time in 2010 midterm election cycle , the democrats had the advantage in the generic ballot . \"\nsurveys conducted in the middle of a major event may have a very short shelf life , \" cautioned rothenberg . \"\nafter the current confrontation ends , voters could easily return to their default partisan positions – or the shutdown and debt ceiling showdown could have created a new partisan baseline from which the gop can never recover . \"\nand while the generic ballot is a useful gauge , it 's important to remember that the battle for the house is a district-by-district fight , rather than a national race , and just 17 of the 232 house republicans are in districts won by obama in last

{"document": "july is when medical trainees are most inexperienced .\n( time.com ) -- \" do n't get sick in july . \"\nthis is a common refrain in teaching hospitals .\nit 's driven by the academic calendar : july is when the new interns — fresh out of medical school — start work .\nit 's also when the senior trainees , the residents and fellows , graduate to supervisory , self-managed patient care roles .\nin other words , it 's when everyone is most inexperienced .\nthe worry is that this inexperience leads to mistakes .\nbut what is less clear is how a doctor 's experience influences the quality of their care .\non its face , it makes sense that the longer a doctor practices , the more expertise she gains — which means better care for you .\nbut , in reality , it 's not that simple .\nsay , for instance , your doctor tells you : \" in my experience , this antibiotic works great for sinus infections . \"\nfair enough .\nit may also be completely true from your doctor 's perspective : when she has prescribed antibiotics in the past for sinus infections , patients got better .\nbut statements like this make us cringe , for two reasons .\nfirst , as it turns out , antibiotics do n't actually work for most sinus infections .\nin a large study published in the journal of the american medical association earlier this year , people with sinusitis were randomly assigned to take antibiotics or a placebo .\npeople treated with antibiotics did no better than those who got the sugar pill .\nthe reason that bacteria-killing antibiotics do n't help when you have sinusitis is because the infection is almost always caused by a virus .\nthe second — and perhaps more cringe-worthy — part is the summoning of the phrase \" in my experience \" as the major reason to prescribe the drug .\nin the case of sinus infections and antibiotics , doctors ' experiences ( and those of patients ) support the wrong decision .\nhere 's why : the natural course of most sinus infections is to resolve on their own over time .\npeople tend to go to the doctor — and get their antibiotics — when they are at their sickest .\nso they and their doctors falsely attribute their improvement to the antibiotic pills .\nhere , experience gets in the way of the right medical decision , which is to avoid antibiotics in the first place .\ntime.com : what the affordable care act means if you are ... so let 's get back to the july effect and the inexperienced , error-prone interns .\non one hand , some studies suggest that the july effect is a myth : a recent study examining 10 years of data on patients undergoing neurosurgery showed that july was no more dangerous than other months .\non the other hand , reports have found that july patients do indeed fare worse : in a study of patients undergoing surgery for spine-related cancer , july patients were more than twice as likely to have a surgical complication and 81 % more likely to die , compared with august or june patients .\na recent systematic review of all the research done on the topic concluded that many of the studies showing no july effect had small sample sizes and were not rigorously done , but the bigger and better investigations leaned toward finding that july is truly a more dangerous month in teaching hospitals .\nso is medical experience good or bad ?\nwell , in most cases , your doctor 's experience is very helpful , allowing her to pick up on a very subtle symptom early in a disease process , for instance , or to determine the right treatment when your condition falls outside of what is taught in textbooks .\nand for many medical treatments — especially the highly technical ones — there 's a direct correlation between physician experience ( the number of procedures she 's performed ) and your outcome ( whether the procedure works ) .\nin a variety of situations , though , experience can backfire , and the reason is simple psychology .\ndoctors are human too , and they fall prey to tricks of the mind — like thinking that an ineffective treatment really works ( ahem , antibiotics for sinus infections ) .\nin fact , entire fields of research are devoted to understanding why these errors of thought occur .\nthey spring from so-called cognitive biases and false heuristics : mental shortcuts that can mislead even highly educated , well-seasoned practitioners into making the wrong decisions .\ntime.com : simple design : what health care can learn from the tv remote control here are four key cognitive biases that trick even the smartest physicians : anchoring bias , which causes doctors to lock onto a diagnosis early and disregard new and conflicting information .\nfor example , a patient may be diagnosed with a quickly fatal cancer , but then ends up trying various ( ineffective ) herbal remedies and lives for 30 more years .\ninstead of considering whether the initial diagnosis was incorrect , the patient — and maybe even the doctor — may falsely assume that the herbal remedies cured the cancer .\navailability bias , when clinicians tend to think that the patient they are treating today has the same condition as the patient they treated last week .\nimagine your doctor saw a rare , life-threatening illness last week that presented with a common symptom , such as belly pain .\ntoday , you 're in the doctor 's office for belly pain , and your doctor may be unjustifiably concerned that you too have that rare life-threatening disease just because she 's still thinking about it .\nconfirmation bias , which causes doctors to believe evidence when it supports their pre-conceived opinion , while ignoring evidence that contradicts it .\nfor example , let 's say your doctor is pretty certain that you have an infection and orders a test to confirm the suspicion .\nthe test is negative for infection , but she treats you for it anyway because she does n't believe the test results ; meanwhile , she disregards clues that point to another , correct diagnosis .\ncommission bias , when doctors err on the side of doing something — like ordering a prostate biopsy — as opposed to watchful waiting because it seems that doing something is better than a doing nothing .\nas you can imagine , the effects of these biases can be significant , particularly if it leads to the wrong treatment or a wrong diagnosis .\nin the case of antibiotics for sinusitis , for instance , the negative impacts of overtreatment include the promotion of drug-resistant superbugs , higher medical spending and rare but sometimes serious allergic reactions to antibiotics .\nso when does experience help and when does it get the way ?\nthat 's a tough question because there are clearly many benefits to having a highly experienced doctor , such as technically proficiency and knowing the pitfalls of various treatments .\nconversely , there may actually be some intangible benefits to having a less experienced doctor : she may have a more up-to-date education , boundless energy and perhaps less susceptibility to cognitive biases developed by years of thinking and practicing the same way .\ntime.com : should your doctor be napping on the job ?\nthe key here lies in the evidence .\nthe data show that certain procedures have a clear volume-outcome relationship — that is , the more experience a doctor or hospital has , the better their outcomes .\nthese procedures include : open-heart surgery , hernia repairs , obstetrics and trauma care .\nnote that many of the areas where the volume-outcome relationship exists involve technical expertise .\nas malcolm gladwell so popularly noted in his book \" outliers , \" andre agassi got good at tennis through 10,000 hours of practice .\nthe same principle holds with doctors who perform medical procedures .\nthe flip side involves certain medical situations in which medical evidence trumps experience , such as using routine mammograms to screen for breast cancer in women under 50 , prescribing anti-arrhythmia medications for heart rhythm disturbances after heart attack , or adhering to super-tight glucose control in diabetics .\nin all these cases , as new evidence emerged refuting the benefits of what had once been considered standard care , both doctors and patients were shocked into re-thinking treatment decisions .\nhere , what seemed to make sense from years of experience turned out to be wrong .\nso what can you do as a patient to receive the best care ?\nwell , maybe nothing if you get admitted on an emergent basis to a teaching hospital during july .\nbut one thing you should always do is ask a lot of questions .\nit may not always be possible to determine that your doctor has fallen victim to an unconscious thinking trap or that she 's practicing outdated medicine .\nbut asking questions does force your doctor to think and justify decisions about your care .\nsecondly , become an informed patient : try to learn as much as you can about your medical issues and what trusted sources recommend as the \" right \" approach .\neven 15 years ago , it was rare for a patient to crack open a medical textbook to question a treatment decision .\nnow , online resources such as medlineplus , provide both up-to-date and easy-to-understand explanations of complex medical care .\na good summary of evidence-based medicine can also be found at the agency for healthcare research and quality 's website .\ntime.com : googling symptoms helps patients and doctors to be clear , an experienced doctor may provide the best care in the world for you or your loved one .\nbut for some decisions , you 'd be better off if she did n't use that experience as the only reason to choose a medicine or test .\nexperience may make the mechanics of a medical procedure smoother and more efficient , but it can also make medical decision-making messy , and sometimes plain wrong .\nmeisel is an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the perelman

{"document": "that the united states has negotiated in the past with groups and states that have condoned and sponsored terror is beyond contention .\nbut should it do so in the future ?\nand , equally important , should it try to impose or try to influence others who are considering negotiating , specifically the families of those taken ?\nthese are tough questions , so let 's get the easy stuff out of the way first .\nthere 's no question that negotiating with terror groups , paying ransoms , incentivizes these activities , undermines america 's credibility , sets terrible precedents and encourages copycats and more terror .\nhow could it not ?\nnothing in life succeeds like success .\nand whether it 's a legitimate business or criminal enterprise , if something is working , the tendency is to do more of it .\nas a consequence , and given the stakes , the official position of the u.s. government is that it does not negotiate with terrorist groups ( even though as the nuclear negotiations with iran attest and the recent opening to cuba , too , the united states does engage with countries that have been designated state sponsors of terrorism ) .\nthe most obvious exception to the u.s. government 's rule on negotiating was the reagan administration 's efforts during the 1980s to seek the return of hostages held by lebanese shia groups , famously revealed in the iran contra affair .\nand there was the green light given to israel to release hundreds of shia prisoners in 1985 in what amounted to a quid pro quo to win the freedom for u.s. citizens on hijacked twa flight 847 .\nbut there have been other , more recent , examples .\nthese include facilitating the exchange of peter moore , a british national kidnapped by shia militiamen in baghdad in 2007 , for qais al-khazali , former spokesman for shia cleric muqtada al-sadr , who was implicated in the killing of u.s. soldiers in karbala .\nand then , of course , there was the bowe bergdahl exchange in 2013 for five taliban officials , a deal that the obama administration insists was n't negotiating with terrorists , in part because the taliban is an insurgent rather than a terrorist group .\n( but as peter bergen has pointed out , the haqqani network has been designated a foreign terrorist organization ) .\ndirect or indirect , insurgent or terrorist , these are for the most part distinctions that do n't really amount to real differences .\nand if you push the argument too far , they make the united states look inconsistent and hypocritical .\nbut these are in the past , you might say .\nwhat about now , particularly in the wake of the threat from isis and the beheading of american citizens ?\nwell , the french government , despite denials , was reported by the new york times to have succeeded in buying back kidnapped nationals from isis .\nin addition , four employees of a french nuclear firm were also freed after having been held by an al qaeda affliliate in northern niger , reportedly in return for money , although the french government denied this .\nthat said , the buying back of americans from isis may present even greater challenges , especially when isis sets price tags like the $ 132 million it demanded for james foley , or as it proved in the case of the two japanese nationals and jordanian pilot , that the group was never serious about negotiating .\nstill , even given these enormous demands , should the united states change its policy and try to secure the release of its citizens , most likely for money , when they 're in mortal peril , particularly if escape or rescue are n't options ?\nit is interesting that in response to isis ' hostage taking , president obama ordered a review of u.s. policy on this issue .\neven though other countries , particularly israel , negotiate and trade with terrorist groups , it is virtually certain that washington wo n't change its official policy .\nbut it should -- in the event there are real opportunities to redeem hostages -- look the other way , if not facilitate the efforts of private individuals or family members who can raise funds to secure the release of family members ?\nsure nobody wants to give in to terror and enable more hostage taking .\nbut on the other hand , do we just write these americans off as simply unlucky souls in the wrong place at the wrong time ?\nafter all , if this was your son , father , husband , wife , daughter or sister , would that be an acceptable response from your government ?\nthese matters raise serious moral and ethical questions that are excruciatingly painful to answer .\nthe war against this kind of terrorism is likely going to be a long and painful one .\nand we may well have to wrestle again with some very tough choices .\ndo we maintain a principled position against negotiations , discourage private citizens from their own efforts -- even threaten to prosecute them if they try to pay ransom ?\nor do we approach each terror-filled hostage-taking situationally and maintain some flexibility to see whether lives can be redeemed ?\ni 'd be in favor of the latter .\ngiving into murderous terrorists is horrible

affairs at princeton university .\nhe is the author of \" jimmy carter \" ( times books ) and author of the forthcoming book \" governing america \" ( princeton university press ) .\n( cnn ) -- sometimes it feels like president clinton never left the public spotlight .\nalthough there were moments during the 2008 campaign when it seemed he was as much of a target within his own party as were the republicans , these days clinton is everywhere and democrats want him by their side .\nmembers of president obama 's campaign team say clinton will offer them his services next year .\nthe re-emergence of president clinton in obama 's circles has been gradual .\nit has taken time to recover from the tensions that flared during the 2008 democratic primaries , when some democrats accused clinton of making racist remarks following obama 's victory over sen. hillary clinton in south carolina .\nbut over the past year , the white house has brought him back on more and more occasions to strengthen obama 's standing .\nwhat explains the former president 's appeal -- beyond his knowing how to work the necessary magic that got him re-elected in 1996 and left booming approval ratings at the end of his presidency ?\nhis strengths offer some guidance for president obama to improve his standing , even beyond his campaign .\nthe first is that president clinton was very successful at counteracting republicans when they attacked .\none of president obama 's great frustrations has been the \" messaging wars . \"\nhe has frequently been frustrated by how the gop portrays him to the public and defines his policies in unfavorable ways .\nclinton did n't let the gop do that easily .\nwhen republicans painted the president as left of center early in his term , he responded by aggressively highlighting his centrist credentials , lowering the deficit in 1993 and reforming welfare in 1996 .\nalthough he accepted their terms of debate , unlike when president obama has done the same , he was able to follow through on that co-optation by strengthening his party 's standing .\nwhen house republicans shut down the government over spending , clinton helped convince the public that they were extremists , forcing republicans to backtrack .\nwhen the gop started the process to impeach president clinton in 1998 and 1999 , he focused public attention on that process , which he said was driven purely by partisan concerns .\nrepublicans said that the president was corrupt .\nthe president responded that republicans were simply using impeachment for partisan purposes .\nhis approval ratings skyrocketed .\nthe gop struggled .\nthe second reason is that president clinton was relentless in his focus on the economy .\nclinton , who famously campaigned with \" it 's the economy , stupid \" in 1992 , never took his eye off the ball .\nhe continued to hammer away at the recession that he inherited and did n't stop talking about the problems americans faced .\nalthough clinton did turn his attention toward health care in 1993 and 1994 , he continued to work on the economy , such as the family and medical leave act .\nhe proposed enterprise zones to try and revitalize urban areas and fought against republican proposed cuts to key domestic programs .\nduring the rebound of the mid-1990s , clinton was in a good position to claim credit for the improved circumstances .\npresident obama has certainly worked hard to improve the economy .\nin more dramatic fashion than clinton , he persuaded congress to pass an economic stimulus bill as well as financial regulation .\nbut too often , president obama has seemed focused on other concerns , whether it was health care reform in his first two years as president or deficit reduction after the midterm elections .\nthe situation has left many democrats yearning for a president who understood that economic recovery was the top priority for many in the party .\nthe final reason is that president clinton displayed a phenomenal ability to show empathy with americans who were suffering , whether they were struggling with hard economic times or were the victims of the oklahoma city bombing .\nalthough empathy is much different from policy , it was clear that clinton 's ability to forge connections with voters in small groups , or even through speeches , was one of the reasons his polls remained so strong .\nthis has been one of the hardest challenges for the president , who often seems distant and disconnected from the problems facing the country .\nobama , a skilled orator , has had trouble connecting to voters at this level .\nnone of this is to ignore the many democrats who still look back to the clinton years with a skeptical eye .\nafter all , some democrats argue that he helped to promote the deregulatory policies that fueled the financial meltdown and that he did little to reverse the growing economic inequality in america .\nnonetheless , many aspects of his presidency are attractive in retrospect .\nfor all these reasons , president clinton is back .\nthe man who often positioned himself against the clinton legacy is running side by side with him .\nbesides the campaign for reelection , president obama should spend some time thinking about what lessons clinton has to offer this presidency in the final months of his first term -- and in his second term , should that come to pass .\nthe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of julian zelizer .", "summary": "julian zelizer : bill clinton has reemerged and is out to help

{"document": "a sage supporter at the new york gay pride parade in june .\nsage works to improve conditions for older lgbt people .\n( cnn ) -- the generation of gays and lesbians that literally created the modern lgbt movement -- from the heroes of the 1969 stonewall riots to their slightly younger friends -- is at , or nearing , retirement age .\nthat used to mean the beginning of an extremely difficult time in an lgbt person 's life .\nbut as gay baby boomers find more acceptance in mainstream society and continue to do what they 've always done -- push to make a better world for the lgbt community -- their retirement options are slowly improving .\nthat is , if they decide to retire at all . \"\nthe notion of retirement has never been a part of my vocabulary , \" said bob witeck , ceo and co-founder of witeck communications .\nnearly 61 , witeck has put some thought into what he should do with his strategic public relations and marketing firm as he gets older .\nlike many friends his age who are also entrepreneurs , he plans to keep working .\nbob witeck , right , and his partner , bob connelly . \"\nbecause i run a business , as i get older i can change the intensity of my engagement in the kinds of work i take on , \" witeck said . \"\ni know i 'm lucky that way , and i 'm lucky in my personal life as well .\nmy husband is 50 , so i have a younger man to help me if i need it , \" he said , laughing .\nfor decades , according to published studies and reports , many lgbt seniors entered into a kind of dangerous isolation , because the majority did not have children or spouses to help care for them .\neven if they did have the benefit of a partner to help as their health declined , they faced extra burdens their straight counterparts did not have .\nwithout federal marriage equality , gay couples -- no matter how long they 've been together -- can not inherit each other 's social security benefits , even if they were legally married in the handful of states that allow it .\nthey can be designated as the beneficiaries of each other 's retirement savings , but must pay inheritance taxes that straight widows and widowers do not .\nin order to make health care decisions on behalf of an incapacitated partner , gay couples must pay additional legal fees to be granted medical power of attorney .\nhistorically , nothing could stop a hospital or nursing home from forbidding a gay person from visiting their partner , and openly gay people often faced discrimination from health care providers , according to the national gay and lesbian task force report , \" outing age 2010 . \"\nconsequently , many lgbt seniors ended up going back into the closet as their declining health and mobility left them dependent on strangers for help , according to a study conducted by the national senior citizens law center , lambda legal and others .\nor they were slow to ask for help -- even if they badly needed it . \"\nwhen you put that together -- the absence of adult children and a partner to help , and add barriers to accessing services , and limit the financial means others have -- then this very thin network of support breaks at exactly the wrong time , right when there is an increasing need for services , \" said michael adams , executive director of the group services & advocacy for gay , lesbian , bisexual & transgender elders , known as sage .\nread more : growing old openly gay witeck said his retirement plans and those of his friends are nothing like those of their fathers ' generation . \"\nmy father was of the generation that thought you put in your time and then you just take off the rest , and many could afford to do it , \" witeck said . \"\nhe had absolutely no plans and had a generous pension . \"\nhis father worked on capitol hill for a couple of decades , witeck said , and was able to retire at 60 .\nhe lived another 27 years . \"\nover time he did get a little discouraged because he felt like he did n't have a purpose , but that 's what the people he knew did , \" witeck said . \"\nthey just abruptly stopped working .\ni can tell you , that wo n't be me . \"\nhe has , however , seen some friends whose plans to continue working have been derailed by health problems . \"\ni do know , as we age , our health can fail , and i 've seen it with some friends who are n't as sharp as they once were .\nso i know it 's a roll of the dice on how long we can keep working , \" he said . \"\nhopefully i can stay healthy and wo n't need the help . \"\nbut often retirement-age people do need help , and that has not always been easy for the lgbt community . \"\nthere is no question we are making a lot of progress in this area , and we 've absolutely been helped along by the emergence of boomers into retirement years , but by the very nature of the enormity of this work , true change will take years , \" adams said .\nhis organization , sage , has been working to change the situation for older lgbt people since 1978 .\nmuch has changed for the community since then , he said . \"\nespecially since the obama administration took office , \" adams said . \"\nthe federal approach to aging issues has improved . \"\nwhile there still is n't federal recognition of marriage for gay couples , the federal pension protection act of 2006 allowed a rollover option to nonspousal beneficiaries .\nthat meant people could leave their pensions to anyone without a tax penalty .\nin the past , only married spouses were eligible for that benefit .\nin 2010 , obama issued a memorandum requiring all hospitals receiving medicare or medicaid funds -- nearly every hospital in the united states -- to respect the right of all patients to choose who may visit them during a hospital stay , including a same-sex domestic partner .\nthe president also directed the department of health and human services to help ensure that medical decision-making rights of lgbt patients are respected .\nthis year the administration on aging -- the federal agency responsible for funding programs that help the elderly -- finally issued guidance saying agencies and programs it funds should recognize the lgbt population among those with \" the greatest social need . \"\nthat designation means that there should be more financial backing and programs to help elderly gay people .\nthe administration on aging spends more than $ 2.3 billion annually on nutrition and social services for the aging , according to adams , but the lgbt community only sees $ 2 million of that .\nfinally , sen. michael bennet , d-colorado , introduced the lgbt elder americans act this year .\nif enacted , it would further boost support for the community .\nas it is written now , the older americans act , which goes up for reauthorization every five years , does not specifically mention lgbt older adults .\namong the lgbt elder americans act 's proposals is an amendment that would permanently establish the national resource center on lgbt aging , which would provide training to providers of services to the elderly around the country .\nit would also require long-term care ombudsmen to collect data relating to discrimination against lgbt older adults .\non the local level , however , everything may not be as rosy . \"\nwhile the laws have become more accepting of marriage equality of the lgbt community and nondiscrimination policies in a broader sense are more inclusive , that does n't mean people who work with the elderly automatically become more accepting , \" said laurie young , director of aging and economic security with the national gay and lesbian task force . \"\nthere is often high turnover in nursing home staff and a lack of professionalism , \" she said . \"\nsometimes even the leadership will get it ( being inclusive of lgbt people ) , but it does n't get passed on to the people working with the lgbt community . \"\nseveral organizations , such as the national gay and lesbian task force and sage , have made training the staffs of senior centers , nursing homes and assisted living facilities a priority .\nthey want those workers to become more sensitive in their work with gay people , particularly because members of the baby boomer generation are more likely to be open about their sexuality than previous generations . \"\nlgbt people want to experience the services and programs that exist for all older people , \" adams said . \"\nso our work has shifted to try and bring along aging and health service organizations so they 're as accessible as possible to the lgbt community . \"\nsage , the national gay and lesbian task force and other groups also train ombudsmen to intervene if an lgbt person comes forward with a complaint .\nthey encourage facilities to create more gay-friendly paperwork , so instead of requesting the name of a husband or wife , the forms include space for a spouse or partner .\neven changing the decorations can help . \"\nthese changes do n't have to cost a lot , \" young said . \"\nwe 've talked about something as simple as having photos in the lobby of the senior center or nursing home that are more reflective of a broader population -- anything to signal that the space is more welcoming . \"\neven in the short time that sage has been conducting its training , it has seen a difference , adams said . \"\nin the past few years we started to notice a real change in the reception of our calls , \" he said . \"\nwe used to reach out to these organizations and hear , ' oh , we do n't have any gay people using our services , ' and occasionally we 'd have even hostile responses .\nnow our offers to help have been increasingly met with a desire on the part of these service providers to do a better job working with lgbt folks . \"\nwiteck said he hopes he will never need those support services , but if he does , he 's confident his generation will continue to make them more accessible to the lgbt community . \"\nwe , meaning baby boomers , are such a huge and active bunch , \" witeck said . \"\ni 've seen it so many times before : where we go , institutions change .\ni know with different generations in the past , there were serious isolation issues and institutions that refused to see us as full human beings . \"\nbut when i think of the arc of change for true equality for lgbt people and how much has gotten better since my generation was in high schooland college , it 's way beyond what i ever imagined was possible , \" he added . \"\nand i imagine it will get that much better for all of us ,

what to register for , planning and preparing for an upcoming wedding can sometimes be tricky .\nnavigating through each and every sticky situation with a smile can be hard work .\nenter anna post .\nthe etiquette expert and co-author of \" emily post 's etiquette , 18th edition \" is here to set the record straight on some of the most frequently asked wedding dilemmas .\nwho should be the first to know about my engagement ?\navoid broadcasting the news ( photos included ) to social networks before sharing your engagement with family and friends .\nif you have any children from a previous marriage , they should be told first .\nparents , family members , godparents , and anyone you are particularly close with should also be told before the news is public knowledge .\nam i supposed to bring a gift to an engagement party ?\ntraditionally gifts were not expected at the engagement party but , some guests opt to bring a small token -- like champagne flutes -- for the couple .\nbecause engagement gifts are n't a standard everywhere , do n't expect presents to be opened at the event .\nreal simple : splitting the wedding tab can i have someone besides my father walk me down the aisle ?\nthe bride 's father traditionally walks her down the aisle , but you can have anyone who is significant — mom or stepdad , brother or sister — walk you down the aisle .\nyou can even walk alone or with more than one person .\nno matter who walks you down the aisle , do n't let it be a last-minute decision .\nthe most important thing is to maintain an open and honest dialogue with anyone impacted by your choice .\n14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' 14 ways to say ' i love you ' how do i get my guests to rsvp ?\ngive guests at least 15 days between the invitation 's arrival and the rsvp deadline to figure out the logistics .\nsending pre-stamped enclosure cards or permitting rsvp via email may also encourage guests to respond faster .\napproximately one week before the numbers are due to vendors , make follow-up calls to guests who have yet to reply .\nthis is a great time to ask your wedding party or family for some help .\nreal simple : wedding fashion 101 if i know someone ca n't attend , do i need to send an invitation anyway ?\nbecause an invitation comes with the expectation of a gift , you do n't want people to think they have to give a gift even though they can not attend .\nif someone lets you know that they have a conflict , do n't follow up with an invitation .\nin the case of very close friends and family , you may want to send an invitation anyway with a note that explains you are sending it as a keepsake .\nhow can i back out of my duties as a bridesmaid if i ca n't afford it or no longer want to do it ?\nif you think financials might be a problem , talk with the bride about what expenses you might incur before accepting .\nbridesmaids typically pay for their own attire ( including any alterations ) , hair , makeup , and any travel expenses .\nthough the maid of honor may have a bigger time commitment , there is not necessarily a greater monetary obligation .\nother than illness , family emergency , or an iron-clad work demand , it 's not acceptable to back out once you 've committed .\nif you have no choice but to cancel , it 's important to let the bride know as soon as possible .\nreal simple : how to address wedding invitations what are my duties as a bridesmaid ?\nbridesmaids generally assist in the planning of the wedding , help the bride choose her dress , attend fittings for their own dresses , and attend any parties they are invited to .\nthough it often makes sense for bridesmaids to throw the bridal shower , they are not required to do so .\nduring the wedding festivities , bridesmaids act as an ambassador of sorts to the couple and may be expected to help with the little details that keep the day running smoothly .\nthey should also participate in any activities like a receiving line or a bouquet toss .\ncan i skip the cake ?\nthere are certain traditions , like cutting the cake , that are okay to omit .\ninstead of cake , you may opt for something that provides more variety such as a candy bar or a selection of pies -- it 's up to you .\nif you do skip the cake , be aware that the cake cutting ceremony and serving of dessert is typically the signal to guests that it is ok to leave without being rude .\nreal simple : how to include your dog in your wedding day who hosts the bridal shower ?\nanyone from the bridesmaids to the mother of the bride to the mother of the groom can host a bridal shower .\nin any case , the hostess should consult with the bride about the guest list , because shower guests should also be invited to the wedding .\nis it ok to use mobile devices to upload pictures during the wedding ?\nwhen in doubt , it 's better to ask the couple 's permission before posting photos to any social media outlet -- especially during the ceremony .\nuploading photos not only distracts you from participating in the moment , but it also broadcasts details of the event to people who may not have been invited .\nreal simple : help !\nmy sister copied my ring !\ndo n't miss out on the conversation we 're having at cnn living .\nfor the latest stories and tell us what 's influencing your life .\nhow do i decide who can bring a date ?\nyou should extend a plus one to anyone who is in a committed relationship , whether married , engaged , or in a live-in partnership -- even if you have n't met the other half .\nyou are not obligated to give single guests and guests who are involved in more casual relationships the option to bring a date .\nyou do , however , want to be consistent and avoid making exceptions .\nif the invitation does not say , for example , anna and guest , guests can assume they can not bring a date .\nif someone does show up with an uninvited guest , avoid an uncomfortable situation by finding a place for them and follow up with the invited guest via a polite phone call afterward .\nhow much should i spend on a wedding gift ?\nthere is no minimum or maximum .\nwhen shopping for a wedding gift you should consider two things : your personal budget and your relationship with the couple .\nit 's not necessary to pay for the cost of your dinner , but rather spend what you can afford and feel comfortable spending on something that suits the couple .\ndo n't be afraid to diverge from the registry if you need to .\nreal simple : the best wedding gift i ever received if someone asks me to be in their wedding , do i have to ask them to be in mine ?\nyou should n't feel obligated to reciprocate .\nif you feel uncomfortable about the situation , ask them to be a reader or to fulfill some other role in the wedding .\nsimilarly , it 's a nice gesture to include your fiancé 's siblings in the wedding party , but you are not required to do so .\ndo i need to invite someone i casually mentioned the wedding to ?\ntalking about the wedding is ok , but do n't extend an invitation unless you know a formal invitation will follow .\nit 's impolite to uninvite someone , even if it was a verbal commitment .\nif the topic arises , you can diplomatically skirt around the issue by saying you have n't finalized the guest list .\ni 'm paying for the wedding myself , how can i tell my parents i do n't want to invite certain people ?\nit may be best to give your parents an allotted amount of spots they can fill as they wish .\nif there are certain people you do not want in attendance , it 's best to have a private and honest conversation when you first discuss the guest list .\ndo n't insist your parents feel comfortable with the situation , but be clear about your wishes .\nam i expected to invite all of my coworkers ?\nyou do not have to invite everyone you work with , but try to pick a logical dividing line , like your division or team , so people do n't feel excluded .\ntreat any invited coworkers as you would friends , and invite them outside of work .\nmail invitations to their home addresses and discuss wedding plans outside of the office .\ncan i tell my bridesmaids what kind of shower i want ?\nit 's a good idea to discuss the shower with bridesmaids -- or whoever is hosting -- but avoid demands , especially those that dictate the budget .\nfor example , if you really do n't want games , you may express that sentiment but shy away from requests that add extra expenses .\nhow do i deal with guests who ask to bring kids even after we 've made it clear they 're not invited ?\nyou have to nip this in the bud .\ncall the guest ( even if they 've contacted you through another medium , like email ) and kindly , but firmly explain that the invitation was just for the adults and that you hope they can still attend .\ndo n't make exceptions -- it 's not fair to other guests who respect your wishes .\nyou can , however , invite the flower girl and the ring bearer without being hypocritical .\ncan i register for gifts if it 's my second marriage ?\nwhether it 's your first marriage or your third , you can still register .\nthere are plenty of people who may want to giveyou a gift , including those who have attended a prior wedding .\nif you feel uncomfortable about receiving gifts , it 's a good time to get creative and sign up for a honeymoon registry .\nit 's also perfectly fine to request guests do not bring gifts .\nwhat is the correct way to address a wedding gift check ?\nthere is no hard and fast rule about which party should be addressed .\nunless you know the couple has a joint bank account , pay to the order of either the bride or the groom -- not both -- to make the check easier to cash .\nwho should host the rehearsal dinner ?\ntraditionally , the groom 's family hosts ( and pays for ) the rehearsal dinner and arranges a guest list in conjunction with the bride 's family .\nthough some families now choose to split the cost or let the bride and groom host their own rehearsal dinner , the groom 's family should get \" first dibs . \"\nam i obligated to invite a guest 's date to the rehearsal dinner ?\nbecause the rehearsal dinner is traditionally a close-knit event for wedding participants and family , it is not necessary to extend an invitation to an attendee 's wedding guest .\nhow much should i tip my wedding vendors ?\nyou do not have to tip vendors with whom you have a contract .\ndepending on service and relationship , a small gift or a cash tip is at your discretion .\nyou should , however , distribute tips to non-contracted staff like musicians and servers .\nmeals for vendors are typically included in your contract , but you should plan to pay for their dinner regardless .\ndiscuss meal options with your venue or caterer to find something that works with your budget .\nhow long do i have to send a thank-you note ?\nthough it 's best to send a thank-you note as soon as possible , you have approximately three months to express your gratitude .\nif the three-month timeframe has elapsed , send any lingering thank-you notes as soon as possible .\nsending an email or putting a generic thanks on social media , your wedding website , or anywhere else does not replace a handwritten note .\nto save time , the bride and groom can both write thank-you notes and simply sign each one .\nin a serious time crunch , it 's acceptable to send an email that acts as a digital placeholder to say you received the gift and a thank-you a note will follow .\nhave you run into a sticky wedding etiquette situation ?\nwe 'd love to hear all about how that worked

.\nthey are the authors of \" moving families forward : third-way policies that work \" ( nyu press ) .\n( cnn ) -- fannie mae , freddie mac , and the federal housing administration own about 250,000 foreclosed properties awaiting resale .\nhundreds of thousands of additional units will likely be taken over by the government and become available in the next few years .\nat least another 250,000 foreclosed properties are awaiting sale in the private market .\nthis drag on the housing market is one of the reasons why housing prices continue to fall and new housing construction is stalled .\nall these properties could provide families with housing instead of sitting empty ( and , in some cases , looking the part ) .\nto increase the use of idle government properties and recover some of the massive losses on mortgages , the obama administration is looking mainly for proposals from firms or nonprofit organizations to buy and rent out the vacant properties .\nthe department of housing and urban development gets a gold star for this new strategy , but pursuing another approach at the same time — helping more families become homeowners — would take us further still toward ending the housing crisis .\nboth approaches would reduce rents : as more renters buy vacant homes , demand for rentals will ease , and renting out vacant units will increase the supply of rental housing .\nboth approaches are also likely to jack up demand for idle or underemployed construction workers , who 'd be needed to repair and renovate the properties .\nright now , millions of families are paying more in rent than the monthly carrying costs of owning a comparable property .\nin 2009 , 3 million families with children and annual household incomes below $ 30,000 were paying more than $ 800 per month in rent , according to the 2009 american community survey .\nif they can pay that much , they could certainly afford homes costing at least $ 115,000 — well above the value of homes at the 25th percentile of the price curve .\nwith better access to financing , they could take advantage of bargain prices on foreclosed or other properties , and homeownership would immediately cut renters ' housing costs and lock in great rates .\nsome past efforts at promoting homeownership failed when bad mortgages supported housing costs far higher than monthly rents on the expectation of home price appreciation .\nbut that does n't mean we ca n't learn from past mistakes or take advantage of the current market context to make a major dent in family housing costs by using idle housing and human resources .\nas we spell out in our book , \" moving working families forward , \" the government could create 1 million homeownership vouchers to cover the carrying costs of homes up to the 25th percentile of area home prices .\ngiven today 's low-home prices , such a plan would cost no more than about $ 3 billion per year and could be at least partially financed by phasing out the more costly and supply-oriented low-income housing tax credit , which offers a reduction in tax liability to property owners and private investors who develop low-income housing — and is a corporate honey pot that yields high profits and relatively few units for low-income families .\na second approach would use turnkey programs .\nfirms and nonprofit organizations would purchase homes , qualify the buyers through credit counseling and credit repair , ready buyers for homeownership , make modest renovations and repairs , and sell the properties .\nwith this option , like the homeowner voucher , government could lay claim to a modest share of any capital gain ( say 15 % -20 % ) when the property is resold .\namong others , the neighborhood reinvestment group of cleveland is already trying the turnkey approach .\nstarting with unused housing from the cuyahoga county land bank , the company hired local construction workers and trained the unemployed to spiff up the units , helped renters correct and raise their credit scores enough to qualify for low interest mortgages and down payment assistance , helped them get financing , and walked the families through the sale .\nsome renters took classes offered in financial literacy , too .\non average , the renters reduced their monthly housing expenditures by a minimum of 25 % , including taxes and insurance .\nas the project scales up to involve scores of properties , it will create new jobs and training opportunities for underutilized construction workers .\nscaling up either homeownership initiative would be a move in the right direction , and either approach would help millions of middle income and near-poor families limit their housing costs .\nfinally , targeting demand policies toward housing can cost-effectively reinvigorate the broader economic recovery because of the close links between construction , manufacturing , and other industries .\njust as important , by taking depressed units out of the housing market , the outlook for future housing prices will improve .\nthis will reduce future foreclosures as more homeowners will make their payments rather than walking away from their mortgage commitments

of the infection she picked up at the hospital , katie , who was 19 at the time , dropped from 120 to 90 pounds .\nthe bacterium that made her so sick is called clostridium difficile , and according to a study out this week , it 's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the united states , and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery .\nthe study found clostridium difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15 % per year from 1997 , when there were 3,565 infections , to 2006 , when there were 7,779 infections .\nthe study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006 , of whom 21,274 , or 0.2 % , had c. diff , as the bacteria are commonly called .\nthe study was published this week in the archives of pediatric and adolescent medicine . \"\nthis is huge , and really concerning , \" says dr. peter pronovost , director of the quality and safety research group at johns hopkins university .\nwhat 's really disturbing , he says , is that these children did n't have to get sick . \"\nmost of these infections are preventable , \" he added .\nkatie was a healthy 19-year-old avid soccer and volleyball player

back to the hospital .\ndoctors found katie had an infection -- not c. diff , but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up . \"\nwhen i woke up from that surgery i thought that was it , i was done , but they told me i 'd be having another surgery in 48 hours , \" she remembers . \"\nand then i had to have another one , and then another one . \"\nkatie and her parents did n't know it , but her situation was the perfect storm for a c. diff infection .\nshe was taking massive doses of intravenous antibiotics , which kill the good bacteria in the gut , and c. diff thrives in the absence of good bacteria . \"\ni was throwing up all the time , and was so weak that one day i just blacked out in my hospital bed , \" she remembers .\nthe antibiotic flagyl cleared up the c. diff ,

torress-cook , epidemiologist for the hospital . \"\nit 's frustrating , because some hospitals say there 's nothing they can do about their c. diff rates , \" he says . \"\nbut that 's no excuse .\nthey could do a lot of things . \"\nbased on pacific hospital 's success , here are some things parents can do to protect their children from c.diff when they 're in the hospital .\nfor more information on preventing other types of hospital infections , see information from the empowered patient and the committee to reduce infection deaths .\n1 .\ngive your child yogurt at pacific , patients at high risk of c. diff are given yogurt because it helps restore the good bacteria in the gut that in turn help fight off bad bacteria .\nif your hospital does n't offer yogurt , torress-cook suggests that you bring it in yourself and that one serving a day is enough to help protect your child .\nif a child ca n't eat , he can take probiotic supplements containing lactobacillus .\nfor babies , breast milk helps protect against c. diff infections .\n2 .\nknow the signs of c. diff infection if your child has watery diarrhea , fever , abdominal pain , fast breathing , or is extremely sleepy , ask your doctor if it could be a c. diff infection . \"\nit 's not any one symptom , but the whole picture that 's important , \" pronovost says . \"\nif as a parent your gut tells you your child just is n't normal , there 's likely truth in that . \"\nhe adds that parents sometimes notice signs of infection before doctors or nurses . \"\nparents are with their kids all the time , \" he says . \"\nand nurses are by the bedside for 12 hours .\nas the attending physician , i actually have the least amount of time with the patient . \"\nc. diff spreads when someone touches the feces of an infected person , and then touches someone else , or touches a surface , such as a doorknob , that someone else will later touch .\nat pacific , officials credit much of their success against the bacteria to a thorough cleaning of every room , even making sure to change the mop head between rooms .\ntorress-cook recommends bringing your own disinfectant wipes and cleaning commonly touched surfaces , such as bedrails .\nthe committee to reduce infection deaths has more information on how routine cleaning by hospital staff might not be enough to control c. diff .\n4 .\nask for a private room kathleen roche says they 'll never know how katie got sick , but they wonder if she got it from a feverish little girl who shared a room with katie during both her first and second hospital stays .\nthe centers for disease control recommends that a patient with c. diff have his or her own room .\nif you 're concerned your child 's roommate is ill -- or that your child is ill -- you can ask to be separated .\n5 .\nmake sure hospital staff wears glove , gowns after katie was moved into her own room , her parents were told to wear gowns to cover their clothing and prevent the spread of their daughter 's infection to themselves and others .\nthey noticed , however , that doctors and nurses did not wear gowns when visiting their daughter . \"\nthere should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff , \" pronovost says . \"\nif there is a difference , it 's likely the staff is being noncompliant . \"\nif you see doctors and nurses are n't gowning up or washing their hands , tell them , pronovost advises . \"\nas a parent i know we worry we 're going to piss off the doctor if we ask too many questions

had received threats which he believed were from allies of the incumbent governor andal ampatuan -- that he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate papers himself .\ninstead , his wife , sister ,

, local officials and analysts have blamed the attacks on ampatuan , who has controlled the area for a decade and is a long-time ally of philippine president gloria macapagal-arroyo .\nampatuan , who is known locally as a warlord , reportedly commands a private army of nearly 500 men .\nphilippine military officials also said monday that the gunmen who carried out the attack were loyal to ampatuan .\nneither ampatuan nor any of his advisers has commented on the slaying allegations . \"\nit 's not hard to determine the motive , \" according to philippine analyst kenneth e. bauzon . \"\nhow dare this [ mangudadatu ] challenge him when he knows that the governor is a position that is presumably reserved for [ the ampatuan ] family . \"\nampatuan reportedly wanted one of his sons to succeed him as governor of maguindanao when he stepped down next year , according to abs-cbn .\nno effort has been spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable -- president macapagal-arroyo a government construction vehicle was found at the site of the hastily dug mass grave , fueling the belief that ampatuan or his allies had a role in the massacre .\nboth the ampatuan and mangudadatu clans have agreed to participate in the government 's investigation into the killings , according to arroyo 's adviser on the mindanao region , jesus dureza , who spoke to the philippine media on tuesday .\nneither ampatuan nor his advisers have spoken publicly about the widespread allegations , and that is most likely because he is \" weighing his options , \" bauzon said .\nnow , the region is bracing for a backlash of possible reprisal killings .\nthe philippine government has placed maguindanao and its surrounding regions under a state of emergency and survivors of monday 's massacre have entered a government witness protection program , according to the state-run philippines news agency .\narroyo has sent top level government officials to maguindanao to \"

matter because this has been tolerated by the arroyo administration , \" said bauzon , a political science associate professor at saint joseph 's college in new york , who is from mindanao and has authored several books on the region and its politics . \"\nso when the administration looks the other way when journalists report on military abuses [ or ] when the administration looks the other way when church workers are assassinated , when environmental workers are assassinated or abducted , you know , this [ massacre ] is just one or two steps away [ from that ] . \"\nthe killings could further damage the political reputation of arroyo , whose administration has already been scarred by allegations of a tainted election in 2004 and criticism over her response to the recent typhoons to strike the country . \"\nit 's a test as to what how far the arroyo administration will go to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators , \" bauzon said .\narroyo 's term ends in may 2010 , and she can not seek re-election although there has been speculation that she could seek another political office .\nmaguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly muslim mindanao which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent muslim homeland in the philippines , a predominantly christian country .\nnegotiations between one of those armed groups , the moro islamic liberation front , and the philippine government broke down last year after the country 's supreme court blocked a proposed peace deal that would have increased the size and scope of the autonomous region in muslim mindanao .\narroyo 's government exercises little control in the region and is blamed by her critics for helping legitimize many of the armed groups that operate freely in mindanao , including those loyal to the governor , ampatuan .\narroyo issued an executive order in july 2006 that allowed local officials and philippine national police to deputize volunteer watchmen , known as barangay tanods , to fight against insurgent groups in the southern regions .\nthis order has been blamed for allowing local politicians to convert their private militias into legal security forces .\nthe strong clan rivalries and the armed groups that support each clan may make it impossible for arroyo to rout out those behind monday 's mass killing , according to bauzon . \"\nthe dynasty is strongly entrenched and for her to disband private armies by this warlord overnight is too much of a task , \" he said . \"\nthe americans were not able to do it in half a century

{"document": "washington ( cnn ) -- iran halted work toward a nuclear weapon under international scrutiny in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until 2010 to 2015 , a u.s. intelligence report says .\na file satellite image shows iranian nuclear facilities .\na declassified summary of the latest national intelligence estimate found with \" high confidence \" that the islamic republic stopped an effort to develop nuclear weapons in the fall of 2003 .\nthe estimate is less severe than a 2005 report that judged the iranian leadership was \" determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure . \"\nbut the latest report says iran -- which declared its ability to produce enriched uranium for a civilian energy program in 2006 -- could reverse that decision and eventually produce a nuclear weapon if it wanted to do so .\nenriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel nuclear power plants , but much higher concentrations are needed to yield a nuclear explosion . \"\nwe judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon is late 2009 , but that this is very unlikely , \" the report says .\na more likely time frame for that production is between 2010 and 2015 , it concludes .\nwatch what new report says about iran 's nuclear ambitions » iran has insisted its nuclear program is strictly aimed at producing electricity , and the country has refused the u.n. security council 's demand to halt its enrichment program .\nmonday 's report represents the consensus of u.s. intelligence agencies .\nit suggests that a combination of \" threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures , along with opportunities for iran to achieve its security , prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways , \" could persuade the iranian leadership to continue its suspension of nuclear weapons research .\navailable intelligence suggests the iranian leadership is guided \" by a cost-benefit approach , \" not a headlong rush to develop a bomb , the report concludes .\nu.s. national security adviser stephen hadley expressed hope after monday 's announcement , but he said iran remains a serious threat . \"\nwe have good reason to continue to be concerned about iran developing a nuclear weapon even after this most recent national intelligence estimate , \" he told reporters at the white house . \"\nin the words of the nie , quote , iranian entities are continuing to develop a range of technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so . \"\nhe said technology being developed for iran 's civilian nuclear power program could be used to enrich uranium for use in weapons , and that iran is continuing to develop ballistic missiles .\nhadley said the intelligence community came to the new conclusions on tuesday , based on information gathered over the past few months , and president bush was briefed about them on wednesday .\nhe said u.s. policy toward iran has not changed because of the new report . \"\nif we want to avoid a situation where we either have to accept iran ... with a path to a nuclear weapon , or the possibility of having to use force to stop it , with all the connotations of world war iii -- then we need to step up the diplomacy , step up the pressure , to get iran to stop their so-called civilian uranium enrichment program , \" he said . \"\nthat 's our policy going forward -- no change . \"\nsen. john d. rockefeller iv , chairman of the senate intelligence committee , welcomed the news . \"\nthe key judgments show that the intelligence community has learned its lessons from the iraq debacle , \" the west virginia democrat said in a statement . \"\nit has issued judgments that break sharply with its own previous assessments , and they reflect a real difference from the views espoused by top administration officials . \"\nthis demonstrates a new willingness to question assumptions internally , and a level of independence from political leadership that was lacking in the recent past . \"\nsen. joe biden , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , said the fact that iran was several years away from nuclear weapons capability meant \" the international community has a significant window of opportunity in which to act to avoid the stark choice between going to war or accepting a nuclear iran . \"\n\" but the bush administration has long lacked a comprehensive strategy to take advantage of this window , \" the delaware democrat and democratic presidential hopeful said in a statement . \"\ninstead of continuing its obsession with regime change and irresponsible talk of ' world war iii , ' we need a policy that focuses on conduct change . \"\nthe international atomic energy agency , the u.n. nuclear watchdog , has reported that iran is cooperating with inspectors by providing access to declared nuclear material , documents and facilities .\nhowever , the agency also said iran is withholding information in other areas , and as a result , the iaea 's knowledge about the status of the program is \" diminishing . \"\niran says its uranium enrichment work is allowed under the 1968 non-proliferation treaty .\nthe u.n. security council has passed two rounds of sanctions against tehran , but washington missed its goal of reaching consensus on tighter restrictions by the end of november , the state department said last week .\nthe report comes amid widespread accusations that the bush administration is attempting to maneuver the united states into a conflict with iran , which it accuses of meddling in the war in iraq .\nin october , the united states designated elements of iran 's revolutionary guard corps as supporters of terrorism .\nnies examine current capabilities and
