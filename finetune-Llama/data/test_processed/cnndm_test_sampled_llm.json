Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration.

{"document": "(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.", "summary": "In his final known video, Adam Gadahn called for governments of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to be overthrown .\nHe was raised in California and said he was of Jewish ancestry .\nHe converted to Islam in 1995, left U.S. in 1998 and joined al Qaeda, becoming a spokesman ."}

He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible.

But after calling the dentist's office, she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning that she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son, Attley. Instead, Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the facility. The pair turned up shortly after - but midway through the appointment, Attley started to create a fuss. Upset: Tayler Chaice Buzbee has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her baby son, Attley (pictured with Tayler) from her arms while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair . 'I don't nurse in public, and I never have because I hear these stories about people being shamed...

But she said that, in this instance, she had no option but to breastfeed Attley - a gorgeous dark-haired baby with big brown eyes and a cheeky grin - because he was hungry and causing a scene. The hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler nursing her son - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished. But Tayler declined and continued to be treated. A short while later, the dentist and another female employee came into the room. The latter reportedly told Tayler that she was not permitted to breastfeed her baby in the dentist's office. Then, while the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, the employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way'. She then placed him in a stroller, it is reported. Tayler, who was shocked, left the office soon after.

Negative emotions are also common for new mothers who are trying to breastfeed in hospital soon after giving birth. These are due to staff actions and comments, the research found.

In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale.

{"document": "A formerly obese man has revealed how he finally became motivated to lose 160lbs from his 354lbs frame over the course of 20 months, after nearly a lifetime of emotional eating and self-loathing. Atlanta-based writer Alex Gray, 27, admitted that he once made excuses for his gluttonous habits, which included trips to drive-through restaurants up to four times a day, but it wasn't until an obese friend 'unveiled a shockingly svelte silhouette' that he was inspired to make changes in his own life . 'There are a lot of platitudes about weight,' he wrote in an essay for Salon. 'One of them is that you should love yourself no matter your size. I’m here to say that’s bullsh**. Being fat sucks. I love myself way more now than I ever have. Scroll down for video . Inner turmoil: Alex aid that he had 'missed out on a lot' when he was clocking in at 354lbs (pictured) New man: The writer was pictured at a Miami Dolphins football game after he lost nearly half of his body weight in 20 months . Alex explained that there are people who are unable to lose weight because of genetics or other factors - but he was not one of them. 'For those who can do something about their size, and simply refuse to, trust me: Life is so much better on the other side,' he explained. Alex said that he couldn't think of a 'specific catalyst' that prompted him to gain weight, but he recalled that he had an insatiable appetite 'as an only child with unabated access to nearly everything'. As he got older, he grew bigger, and by the time he was in college, he found himself struggling with physical intimacy because of his size. Alex recalled one woman who called him out for breathing heavily during one of their sexual encounters. He confessed that the panting was because he was winded - not because he was caught up in the heat of the moment. But the worse he felt about himself, the more he ate. 'I’ve never tried drugs, but I empathize with those addicted to the needle, or the pipe,' he wrote. 'I know what it feels like to be acutely aware your vice is killing you, or at the very least, keeping you from living your best life. Alex explained attempted to lose weight a few times, but neither the promise of an extended football career or a new car could motivate him to stick with it because he was unable to 'escape food's gravitational pull'. It wasn't until he saw his friend Joubert, who once had a similar frame to his, show off his fit new body at a Cinco De Mayo reunion that he became motivated to start making changes in his own life. Days later, Alex went walking, and eventually his walks turned into runs. He made dietary changes too, including swapping burgers for lean rotisserie chicken. It took a little less than two years to reach his 'physical ideal', and Alex explained that his whole world has changed. His only regret is not doing it sooner. Alex noted that not only is he now comfortable with the opposite sex, but for the first time in his life, he is the one who is being pursued. He is thrilled that he can finally buy clothes off the rack at stores such as H&M, adding that he finally feels like he physically fits in. Alex ended his story by saying that he finally started his life at 25-years-old, and to remind others struggling with their weight, that if he can do it, they can do it too.", "summary": "It took Atlanta-based writer Alex Gray 20 months to lose the weight from his 354lbs frame .\nThe 27-year-old said he used to visit the drive-through to get fast food three or four times a day ."}

Mohammed Nisar, 55, had been driving sole trader Adrian Quinn to Walsall train station when the passenger hopped out of the vehicle in a rush, forgetting his rucksack. He had been carrying the hefty sum of money after cashing a cheque from his inheritance following the death of his mother - and on realising his mistake says he felt 'dazed'. Reward: Taxi driver Mohammed Nisar (left) accepts a reward from sole trader Adrian Quinn after returning a bag the passenger left in his taxi containing £10,000 in cash . Mr Quinn, 46, of Hereford, said: 'Losing that money would have been the end of my business. I was physically sick! He realised he had left the bag in the car just seconds after Mr Nisar dropped him at the station. He added: 'I was walking across the car park when I realised I hadn't got my bag and I panicked. I tried to flag down another taxi but they all had fares. 'I was sick. My body just went into shut-down and I didn't know what to do.. I was just in a daze. If I'd lost that bag it would have been the end of my business. 'We have built it up from nothing for the last nine years and we are sole traders. We don't have the backing of banks. It is hard work, but it earns us a living.' After eventually flagging down another cab the father-of-three arrived back at the taxi rank in a flustered state to find Mr Nisar sitting in his car with the bag safely on the passenger seat. Honest cabbie: Mr Nisar believes 'honesty is the best policy' and has returned a number of valuable lost items to passengers in the past . He said: 'I was very emotional. I said, \"Do you know what was in that bag? Put it this way, it is not a box of sandwiches or a newspaper. There is £10,000 in there\".' Mr Quinn gave Mohammed a cash reward to thank him - in an envelope marked 'to my best friend in the world' - and has even invited him and his wife to his home for a family meal. Mr Nisar, 55, said: 'He nearly had a heart attack, he was really worried! 'He came up to me and asked if I realised what was in the bag. He was very, very thankful. He had just bought a car but forgot the bag full of money.' It is not the first time Mr Nisar, who has been a self-employed taxi driver for 15 years, has found things in the back of his car. Only two years ago one passenger left a wallet containing £150 in, but Mohammed drove straight back to the man's home to return it. New friend: Mr Quinn hands a cash reward to Mr Nisar in an envelope labelled 'to my best friend in the world' Now, following his latest find, he is urging fellow taxi drivers to do the same if they find themselves in the same situation. Mohammed said: 'At the end of the day honesty is the best policy. There are some drivers who don't return things but what is the point? 'If the council had not have called me and no-one had have claimed it after 12 or 24 hours I would have taken that bag straight to the police station. 'Mobile phones are the most common thing left behind but most of them now can be traced anyway.

{"document": "(CNN)We want our killers to be kind. To walk into court and show remorse, tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives, or they were temporarily insane. Even though those things may not be true, too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder. Well, Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end and now convicted murderer, made none of those excuses. He walked into court with an air of bravado, his head held high like the $40 million, NFL superstar he was just a couple of years ago. Several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, during the trial. And we didn't like his swagger. Hernandez didn't offer a plausible alibi. He didn't look ashamed or remorseful. He never wept. His own attorney, James Sultan, admitted that Hernandez \"witnessed\" the killing of Odin Lloyd, \"committed by somebody he knew,\" but said his client did not commit the crime. Even before the guilty verdict came down Wednesday, for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant's biggest crime. \"The Arrogance of Aaron Hernandez,\" a New Yorker headline accused. I don't get it. What does it matter that Hernandez was arrogant in court, or walked with too much swagger, or even smiled at his girl? Like it or not, that is who he is. The evidence is what matters. And for once, this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision: guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. It was the right decision. Still, it's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both Lloyd and now Hernandez, who were once friends. Football was the best thing Hernandez ever had, especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006. Hernandez was 16. After that his life got complicated. At 17, Hernandez went off to the University of Florida and seemed headed for greatness. There he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 Bowl Championship Series win. But off the field, his life was to beginning to unravel. Trouble started: bar fights, reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests. He was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a Gainesville, Florida, nightclub. By the time he was drafted in 2010 by the New England Patriots, Hernandez had already been labeled a \"troubled player.\" But neither the Patriots nor the NFL has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the Hernandez case. They did everything right this time. Hours after Hernandez was charged with murder, he was let go from the team. And his coaches didn't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent, family-loving guy, as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble. This time justice worked. There's no reason to second-guess what went wrong, to ask \"How could a star NFLer be a murderer?\" The NFL for the most part does a great job vetting its players, and certainly Hernandez is an anomaly in the league, where despite the ugly headlines, the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding, law-abiding citizens. And Patriots bashers (me included) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting Hernandez despite his troubled past. No one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others, even those closest to us. Not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees, or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people, and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job. There was no way to predict Hernandez would end up a murderer. He was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world, but he still went wrong. Hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom: . According to a law enforcement source close to the case, Hernandez told officers escorting him, \"'Hey man, I'm going to miss you guys. ... I don't need any luck any more.' He gave you the impression, 'It's kinda like no big deal. ... It is what it is.' \"", "summary": "Roxanne Jones: Jury right to find Hernandez guilty, but the waste of life for player and his victim is tragic .\nShe says NFL, Patriots knew his troubled past, but could not have predicted his actions, and both handled case well ."}
{"document": "Playing video games makes you better at learning than non-gamers, a study has claimed. Research found that gaming boosts the ability to learn a number of tasks more accurately, and possibly puts gamers in an 'expert category' of problem solving. But the researchers note they are not quite sure if gaming makes people learn skills better - or if people who learn skills better are more likely to become gamers. Playing video games (stock image shown) may not only improve the ability to perform visual tasks, but also the learning ability for those skills, a study by Brown University in Rhode Island has claimed . The research was carried out by scientists at Brown University in Rhode Island. To conduct the study, the researchers pitted nine frequent gamers against a control group of nine people who game rarely, if ever. They participated in a two-day trial of visual task learning. Subjects were shown an on-screen ‘texture’ of either visual or horizontal lines and had to quickly point out - in a fraction of a second - the one area where an anomalous texture appeared. Parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s. A letter sent by a group of schools in Cheshire raised concerns about the 'levels of violence and sexual content' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification. It warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services. The letter, sent by Nantwich Education Partnership, said allowing children to play these type of games on Xboxes and Playstations is deemed 'neglectful'. In visual processing research this is a standard protocol called a ‘texture discrimination task.’ Prior studies have shown that people can be trained to improve their performance in the task, but if they move on to a second task too quickly, it can interfere with the learning process. The researchers wanted to find out if gamers could overcome this interference better, compared to non-gamers. And the results showed that gamers managed to improve performance on both tasks, while non-gamers did what was expected. That is, they improved on the second task they trained on, but not on the first. Learning the second task interfered with learning the first. The data show that gamers on average improved their combination of speed and accuracy by about 15 per cent on their second task and about 11 per cent on their first task. Non-gamers produced the same average 15 per cent improvement on their second task, but they actually got a bit worse on the first task they learned, by about 5 per cent. Research subjects were shown an on-screen texture of short lines - either vertical or horizontal, first one then the other - and were asked to spot anomalies. Their responses were measured in milliseconds. Gamers were shown to be more successful when learning both tasks than non-gamers . Despite the small number of participants, the results proved statistically significant. ‘When we study perceptual learning we usually exclude people who have tons of video game playing time because they seem to have different visual processing. They are quicker and more accurate,' said senior author Dr Yuka Sasaki, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University. ‘But they may be in an expert category of visual processing. ‘We sometimes see that an expert athlete can learn movements very quickly and accurately and a musician can play the piano at the very first sight of the notes very elegantly, so maybe the learning process is also different. ‘Maybe they can learn more efficiently and quickly as a result of training.’ The exact neural mechanisms underlying visual or perceptual learning are not yet known, Dr Sasaki said, but the study suggests that gamers may have a more efficient process for hardwiring their visual task learning than non-gamers. ‘It may be possible that the vast amount of visual training frequent gamers receive over the years could help contribute to honing consolidation mechanisms in the brain, especially for visually developed skills,’ the researchers wrote. After training on both backgrounds, testing showed that video gamers had done better at learning the first and second. Non-gamers actually did worse on the first. But it was unresolved whether video games improve visual learning or whether good visual learners tend to play more video games . Being certain will require more research. Importantly, the study doesn't prove whether playing video games improves learning ability or whether people with an innate ability become gamers because they find gaming more rewarding. The study also has a stark gender imbalance between the nearly all-male gamer group and the nearly all-female non-gamer group. But the researchers could not find evidence in the literature for gender differences in perceptual learning that would make this disparity worrisome. By documenting these and other apparent cognitive differences between gamers and non-gamers, the field is discovering that there is more to video games than merely passing the time, lead author and graduate student Aaron Berard said. ‘A lot of people still view video games as a time-wasting activity even though research is beginning to show their beneficial aspects,’ Mr Berard said. ‘If we can demonstrate that video games may actually improve some cognitive functioning, perhaps we, as a society, can embrace newer technology and media with positive application.’", "summary": "Researchers at Brown University studied how people learned tasks .\nIt has already been shown gamers learn visual tasks better .\nBut in this study they had higher performance across two tasks .\n'They may be in an expert category of visual processing,' said Dr Sasaki ."}

{"document": "A Russian warship and two bombers strayed close to UK territory yesterday in yet another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences. A destroyer equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel along with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. A map showing the how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth yesterday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Just a few hours later, two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace – prompting the RAF to deploy two Typhoon fighter jets. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on a huge Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled.

April 2015 - Royal Navy's HMS Argyll monitors Russian Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk along with a tanker and a support ship as they move through the English Channel. The incursions are the latest in a long line of apparent tests by Moscow as tensions between Britain and Russia rise. The Nato naval operation – Exercise Joint Warrior – was aimed at encouraging Mr Putin to calm his recent aggression toward the UK. But Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the Kremlin was using Cold War tactics to ‘snoop’ on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a ‘resurgent’ Russia. He said: ‘This is a classic return to the 70s and 80s when every exercise conducted by Nato was snooped on. ‘We’ve trumpeted the fact we are holding such a large exercise and the fact they are snooping on it doesn’t surprise me at all.’ He added that Britain should spend more on defence: ‘Our capability to deal with these sorts of threats is diminishing because we don’t have the manpower... we need resilience.’ A source added: ‘It may be that they are observing the military exercise being held off the coast of Scotland.’ Under a European treaty, the Ministry of Defence were forced to accept an inspection by Russian experts and they arrived in Scotland on Monday. Yesterday the destroyer Severomorsk, a tanker and a support ship returning from the Mediterranean were intercepted by the Royal Navy as they passed through the Channel. Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, a Type 23 frigate with a crew of 185, was sent to monitor the vessels. A source said the Russians may ‘poke their noses in at the exercise off Scotland’ before heading home. An RAF spokesman said the two Bear bombers, which flew off the north-east coast of Scotland hours later, were escorted away. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November a four-strong Russian flotilla sailed through the Channel and earlier this year two Bears flew south of Bournemouth.

{"document": "(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream. With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep. Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate \"Gang of 8\" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border. His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters. Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a \"horrifying precedent.\" Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, \"We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.\"  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against \"one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday.\"  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous. He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership. Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of \"Obamacare\" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for \"Obamacare\" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.) Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue. Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico. Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.", "summary": "Raul Reyes: In seeking Latino vote, Marco Rubio his own worst enemy on two key issues: immigration reform, Cuba relations .\nHe says on health care, climate change and other issues, he breaks from Latinos' positions.

If convicted he faces 20 years' jail in the US. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr . The 45-year-old was in the US working as a research professor and director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island. Cobb took up the position at the US Naval War College in June last year after holding senior military and government roles in Australia and the US, including a recent strategic policy and planning position at US Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. 'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre.

{"document": "Sheriff's deputies undressed the body of a 20-year-old car crash victim  then took inappropriate nude photos of her  at the side of the road, her mother has claimed. Christina Mejia first outlined her accusations in a lawsuit filed against the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Illinois in 2010 and the trial is scheduled to begin next week. Her daughter, Jessica Mejia, was killed in the early hours of December 31, 2009 when her ex-boyfriend, Nicholas Sord, lost control of the car they were traveling in and smashed into a pole. When deputies arrived on the scene, they improperly removed clothing from Mejia's dead body and took photographs of her, according to the lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Christina Mejia is pictured talking about her daughter Jessica, who was killed in a car crash in 2009. She is suing the responding deputies for stripping her daughter nearly naked and taking photos . Loss: Jessica Mejia, 20, was killed when her drunk ex-boyfriend smashed their car into a pole in 2009 . The young woman had been wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and high-heeled shoes but was photographed wearing just her lower undergarment, according to the Chicago Tribune. By doing so, the deputies intentionally caused emotional distress to the victim's family, they say. 'This was a young lady that just died and was treated with less dignity than a deer carcass you find on the side of the road,' family attorney Don Perry told the Tribune. Mrs Mejia added that the photos had left her feeling 'violated' and she accused the deputies' actions of perpetuating  false rumors that the car had crashed because her daughter was on top of Sord. '(People) think my daughter died from having sex, not from somebody being drunk and killing her,' the heartbroken mother told the Tribune. 'By the time everybody else got to the scene... she was partially naked because they made her naked. So the rumors, and the allegations... they made it believable.' But the sheriff's office insisted that it took the photographs at the scene in order to gather evidence that ultimately helped to convict Sord. They called the images 'standard operating procedure'. Locked up: Nicholas Sord, left, was sentenced to 56 months in prison for the deadly crash. Mejia's family filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's office for taking the photos and the trial will begin next week . 'The family suffered an unimaginable loss, and the crime scene photos were taken as our officers investigated this crime and were instrumental in securing a conviction against the person responsible for this tragic death,' spokeswoman Cara Smith said. 'In no way were these photos intended to cause harm to the family.' Sord, whose blood alcohol level was .236 per cent when he smashed his Mercedes SUV into a pole, pleaded guilty to drunken driving last fall and was sentenced to 56 months in prison. Sord was a business partner with former Chicago Blackhawks player Denis Savard and is the son of Bryan Sord, a prominent developer and restaurateur. He and Mejia had dated but had broken up months before the crash.

The Prime Minister has revealed eldest daughter Nancy has taken to likening her father to Phil Dunphy, the embarrassing dad from US hit sitcom Modern Family. He admits the comparison is 'not great', with even his fashion getting the thumbs down from the 11-year-old. David Cameron has revealed eldest daughter Nancy has taken to likening her father to Phil Dunphy (right), the embarrassing dad from US hit sitcom Modern Family . Now in its sixth series, Modern Family is one of the biggest sitcoms to come out of American since Friends . Dunphy, played by Ty Burrell, is one of the stand-out characters in the American show. He is convinced he is a cool parent, a view not shared by his three children or his wife Claire. Mr Cameron, who has often name checked ultra-cool bands to burnish his credentials, revealed the pain of discovering his children really view him as a British version of Dunphy. Nancy has taken to using the putdown 'That is SO Phil Dunphy' to highlight her father's flaws. It occurred on a recent shopping trip, Mr Cameron told The Sunday Times. 'I said, 'That's a nice shirt', and she said, 'Dad, that is so Phil Dunphy'. I thought, 'Oh dear. It's happened'. 'She does regularly say: 'That is so Phil Dunphy'. If you watch Modern Family, you will know what that means. It's not great.' In the show, Dunphy is often mocked by his wife Claire, but has become one of the best loved characters for his pearls of wisdom dubbed 'Phil's-osophy' Samantha Cameron, who has joined her husband on the campaign trail, has also teased the Tory leader over his DIY skills . 'When life gives you lemonade, make lemons. Life'll be all like 'what?!' 'If you're ever in a jam, a crayon scrunched up under your nose makes a good pretend mustache.' 'Some people call me a salesperson. I call myself a salesfriend.' 'If you love something, set it free. Unless it's a Tiger.' 'Watch a sunrise at least once a day.' 'Take a lesson from Parakeets. If you're ever feeling lonely, just eat in front of a mirror.' I got to be the top realtor of the year by thinking inside the box. That's right, I said inside. Because while everyone is chasing each other outside, what is the box? Empty.' 'If you get pulled over for speeding. Tell them your spouse has diarrhoea.' Now in its sixth series, Modern Family is one of the biggest sitcoms to come out of American since Friends, with Dunphy a standout character. The real estate agent's trademark pearls of wisdom have become one of the most popular aspects of the show, and have spawned fansites, online lists and even books. They include gems like: 'If you love something, set it free. Unless it's a Tiger.' Mr Cameron is not averse to making similarly bizarre comments. In the interview he was asked about the low-key nature of the Conservative election campaign so far. Some Tories are asking themselves whether their leader has a tiger in his tank.

Dunphy is often mocked by his wife, particularly by his attempts at DIY around the family home. Last weekend, Samantha Cameron revealed how her husband also struggles with odd jobs. 'Historically, I'm the one with the drill,' she told the Mail on Sunday. 'He's become quite expert at putting together flat-pack furniture over the years. Normally, when I've just had a baby.'

{"document": "Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I recall when a hard man could take no more... THE NO MAS FIGHT . New Orleans, Louisiana . November 25, 1980 . Sugar Ray Leonard v Roberto Duran . The first two of the three fights between the Sugar Man and Hands of Stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing, with Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler engaging each other in some of the ring’s epic battles. By way of a preview, Leonard had defeated the previous — and equally great — Felix Trinidad to win the world welterweight title. Sugar Ray Leonard celebrates after Roberto Duran quit in their fight in Louisiana in November 1980 . Leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the Panamanian in the second fight . GEORGE FOREMAN V MUHAMMAD ALI . October 30, 1974, Kinshasa, Zaire . JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . MUHAMMAD ALI V JOE FRAIZIER . October 1, 1975, Quezon City, Philippines . In his first defence, Sugar Ray had been contentiously outpointed by Duran in Montreal’s Olympic Stadium. So confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision. That was changed to unanimous in Duran’s favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147. There was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of Duran and only two for Leonard — with 10 even. That was described as ‘a monument to indecision’. Come the inevitable rematch eight months later, in the Louisana Superdome in New Orleans on November 25, 1980, controversy was to be replaced by disbelief. Leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the Panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out. Second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability, especially his speed and movement. Duran became frustrated as Leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches . After being caught flush in the face in the eighth round, Duran turned his back and said 'No mas' ‘The whole fight I was moving. Moving. Then voom, I’d snap his head back with a jab. Voom, I’d snap it back again. He’d try to get me on the ropes. I’d pivot, spin off and pow, come under with a punch.’ So it went for more than seven rounds, with Duran becoming increasingly frustrated. In the eighth Leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in Duran’s face. There had been a moment earlier when Leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside. Just before the bell Duran turned his back and walked to his corner, waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee: ‘No mas.’ Spanish for no more. Leonard celebrates after his opponent quit, and said it was more of an achievement than knocking Duran out . The result stunned the watching world, and it took three years for Duran to rebuild his reputation . The watching world was stunned. Here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible. Clearly he felt humiliated. Sensing the reaction Duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in. But his manager Carlos Eleta said: ‘He always eats like that before a fight. He quit because he was embarrassed.’ Duran had been a national icon in Panama and there was anger on the streets at his action. Television commercials featuring him were taken off. It took three years for Duran to restore his high place in his country’s esteem. He did so on June 16, 1983, his 32nd birthday, by knocking out Davey Moore in Las Vegas to win the world light-middleweight title. Rejoicing returned to the streets. Leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide, thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title. But Sugar Ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing Duran to say No Mas. He said: ‘To me, making Roberto Duran to quit was better than knocking him out.’", "summary": "Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao is now just nine days away .\nSportsmail's Jeff Powell has been counting down the greatest fights .\nIn the sixth of a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, we have Sugar Ray Leonard v Roberto Duran .\nLeonard humiliated his opponent until he said 'No Mas' - no more .\nIt took Duran three years to reclaim his mantle as a  hero in Panama ."}
{"document": "Three people have been sent to prison and another two are awaiting sentencing for their roles in a horrific assault on a 53-year-old man, who was beaten, tied to a chair,  and covered in offensive tattoos. A Philadelphia court heard Thursday that Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, was the ringleader of the gang, who have become known as the 'tattoo terrorists'. Campbell believed the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat, Pebbles. Valecce, an unemployed drug addict, had been staying in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, in the city's northeast, however that basement would become a torture chamber where he would be strapped to a chair and violated for three days. Torture chamber: Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21 (left), the ringleader of a gang dubbed the 'tattoo terrorists' was jailed for 20 years Thursday for the abuse in March/April 21. David Harrison (right) is awaiting sentencing . Accomplices: Sandra Ng, 19 (left), Campbell's girlfriend, was sentenced to 23 months in state prison for her role in the shocking assault last year, while another defendant Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial . Campbell apparently discovered that Pebbles had suffered a broken leg and had reason to believe Valecce was responsible. The incident occurred in late March 2014, according to Philly.com. Campbell, his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, cornered Valecce in the basement and took turns punching, slapping and spitting on him. On top of hurting Pebbles, Campbell believed Valecce had also stolen money and some weed. The trio, described by the paper as 'wannabe gangsters', filmed the abuse, with the video played in court this week. 'Please stop,' Valecce could be heard saying while crying into his hands. 'Please, please stop.' Ng could be heard in every video screaming at Valecce to stand up, so she could pummel him and call him a 'b----'. After Valecce was beaten he was tied to a chair. While restrained Campbell tattooed 'RIP Pebbles' onto his right arm along with a smiley face that had breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose. Halin then took over the tattoo gun. He inked swastikas, Stars of David, two variations of the N-word and a penis ejaculating on a rainbow with the words 'Gay Pride' beside it, Philly.com reported. Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists and fractured bones in his face. He was able to escape on April 1 while the others slept and contact police. The incident lasted about 42 hours, the court was told. Scene: The abuse occurred in the basement of a rowhouse on Brighton Ave, Mayfair in north Philadelphia . Dur­ing a search of the house, po­lice al­legedly found a tat­too gun, needles, ink vi­als and re­lated paraphernalia, along with 155 grams of marijuana, sev­er­al bottles of pre­scrip­tion drugs and Valecce's deb­it card, which he claimed had been stolen from him. Valecce has since had the tattoos removed, with a local parlor giving him free service, but says the incident has left him with irrevocable damage. 'I'm scared to go outside now,' Valecce told Common Pleas Court Judge Charles Ehrlich Thursday. 'I have nightmares. I can't sleep.' All three were charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy and false imprisonment. They all pleaded guilty. Campbell's attorney said his client had a rough childhood, with his father leaving, suicide attempts and dependencies on Xanax and weed. He was sentenced to 20 years in state prison. Halin received the same sentence for what he did to Valecce. Ng, whose attorney who said she had fallen in with the wrong people at school, was sentenced to 23 months in a state prison.

{"document": "A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony .

{"document": "A high-level ministerial briefing exclusively obtained by Daily Mail Australia reveals an 'unprecedented' number of Australians could face the death penalty in China for drug smuggling. The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC. Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline.

{"document": "(CNN)Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict. It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others. In court last month, she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street, staring at her own bones. Now, jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath. But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain, she said. \"I don't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this, no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life,\" she said, crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home. \"I do believe, however, that he should be held accountable for his actions. And I'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that.\" Gregory, who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying, said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories, but it's an important step. \"Everything is being brought up again full force. Our lives will never ever be the same, but I hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason, that there's a bigger plan,\" she said. \"I may be standing on one fake leg, but I'm standing here, stronger than ever, because someone tried to destroy me, and he failed.\" For Gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack, Wednesday's verdict brought a mix of emotions, from triumphant vows to move forward, to expressions of gratitude, to debate over whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. There were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in Boston. In fact, there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats. As Tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head, some survivors and victims' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears. As CNN's Alexandra Field noted from inside the courtroom, \"They've waited a long time for this.\" The family of Sean Collier, a 26-year-old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, were terrorists who \"failed monumentally\" in striking fear in people. \"While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families,\" the Collier family said in a written statement. To Richard \"Dic\" Donohue, an MBTA police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the Tsarnaevs in Watertown, the verdicts show that \"as a society, ... terrorism will not prevail, and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation.\" \"Justice has been served today,\" Donahue tweeted. Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal. She doesn't believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan, now dead, persuaded him to take part in the plot, as the defense contended. Dzhokhar, in her view, was \"all in.\" \"Obviously we are grateful for the outcome today,\" Brassard tolder reporters. \"It's not a happy occasion, but it's something that we can put one more step behind us.\" That sense of turning the page was echoed by Bruce Mendelsohn, who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line. The verdicts mean that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a \"convicted killer.\" You can't call it celebration. But there is a newfound peace of mind, at least, in and around Boston. This was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt. And they got through it by rallying around each other, a deep bond reflected in the mantra \"Boston Strong.\" That feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by Wednesday's verdict. And it's evident in people like Heather Abbott, who lost her left leg below the knee. Since then, she's become a living example of someone who wasn't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again, but to run again. \"Nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever,\" Abbott said Wednesday on Facebook. \"But at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken.\" That view was commonly shared. For those hurt -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013, Wednesday was key to their progression. But it's not the end of the road. Just ask Jeff Bauman. The picture of him, bloodied, being rushed through the streets of Boston by good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo, became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack. Even after losing both his legs, Bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life, by marrying and fathering a child. On Wednesday, Bauman said the verdict \"will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed.\" \"But it is a relief,\" he added, \"and one step closer to closure.\" CNN's Ann O'Neill and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.", "summary": "Survivor Jeff Bauman stresses \"we will never replace the lives that were lost\"\nA man who was at the finish line is glad Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is now a \"convicted killer\"\n\"Justice has been served today,\" says a once wounded police officer ."}

{"document": "A Texas A&M, Galveston, professor decided to fail his entire class after he claimed that they cheated in class and were disruptive and rude. In a letter he sent to his strategic management students, Professor Irwin Horwitz claimed that he had seen cheating, heard false rumors about himself and other students and had been called a 'f****** moron' to his face. Horwitz's email said that every single student in the approximately 30-person class would fail because of the behavior he had witnessed during the semester. The university has said that the failing grades Horwitz's wishes to give out will not hold. Texas A&M, Galveston, professor Irwin Horwitz emailed his strategic management class of about 30 students telling them he was going to fail all of them because of the bad behavior he had seen during the semester . In the email - he sent a similar one to administrators - he claimed students cheated in class and participated in 'inappropriate conduct' His email to his students read: 'None of you, in my opinion, given the behavior in this class, deserve to pass, or graduate to become an Aggie, as you do not in any way embody the honor that the university holds graduates should have within their personal character. 'Since teaching this course, I have caught and seen cheating, been told to ‘chill out,’ ‘get out of my space,’ ‘go back and teach,’ [been] called a ‘f****** moron’ to my face, [had] one student cheat by signing in for another, one student not showing up but claiming they did, listened to many hurtful and untrue rumors about myself and others, been caught between fights between students…. 'None of you, in my opinion, given the behavior in this class, deserve to pass, or graduate to become an Aggie, as you do not in any way embody the honor that the university holds graduates should have within their personal character. 'It is thus for these reasons why I am officially walking away from this course. I am frankly and completely disgusted. 'You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that Texas A&M holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course just on a grade level…. I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Inside Higher Ed . 'It is thus for these reasons why I am officially walking away from this course. I am frankly and completely disgusted. 'You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that Texas A&M holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course just on a grade level…. I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Horwitz, who has taught at the college level for 20 years, sent a similar email to senior administrators telling them what he had done, according to Inside Higher Ed. He predicted that his students would protest his decision and told administration that the students were 'your problem now'. A university spokesman said that across-the-board failing grades would be re-evaluated. 'No student who passes the class academically will be failed. That is only the right thing to do,' he said. He added that Horwitz's accusations are being investigated and 'disciplinary action will be taken' against those students who behaved inappropriately. Horwitz, who said he will not teach the class again, called his class's behavior 'disgraceful' and told KPRC that he had never failed a class before and rarely gave out failing grades. 'I was dealing with cheating, dealing with individuals swearing at me both in and out of class, it got to the point that the school had to put security guards at that class and another class,' he said. 'Sometimes learning incorporates tough love.' Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class and each student will be judged academically by the department head rather than Horwitz for the remainder of the semester . He said that his students told him to 'chill out' and cited student cheating in his email. 'It became apparent that they couldn't do some of the most simple and basic things they should have been able to do,' Horwitz told KPRC. Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class, especially before the end of the semester, in May. 'None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail because he or she has not performed the expectations for that particular class,' he said. The department head at the university will teach the course for the remainder of the semester and grades will be evaluated based on academics, school officials said. Horowitz said he would not teach the strategic management class again at the Galveston campus (pictured) and that in his 20 years of teaching he had never failed an entire class .", "summary": "Texas A&M, Galveston professor Irwin Horwitz sent an email to his strategic management class telling the approximately-30-person class would all fail .\nIn the email he said he witnessed cheating, false rumors and bad behavior .\nHe said in his 20 years of teaching he had never failed a class and rarely failed students .\nThe university administration has said that the failing grades will not hold .\nDepartment head is taking over Horowitz's class and students will be graded solely on academics ."}

Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now.

{"document": "West Bromwich Albion had just produced a typical Tony Pulis performance to beat his former club Crystal Palace 2-0 when he claimed he will never change. The 57-year-old’s gritty, resilient playing style is well reflected in the touchline attire he insists on wearing at every game; cap, track suit and shiny white trainers. James Morrison headed in within two minutes and Craig Gardner added a stunning 30-yard strike in the second half, but Alan Pardew’s side dominated the remainder of the game only to be met by West Brom’s stubborn doggedness.

I want to be close to the action.’ West Brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five. Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit and tie on Saturday. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted last week that he started smartening up on the sideline after his chairman Daniel Levy told him to. ‘I’ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,’ Pulis added. ‘I’ve always done it and I don’t see no reason not to just because we’re in the Premier League with all the TV cameras and everything. I’ve done it right from my days at Bournemouth.’ Why change a ritual that works? The three points moved West Brom to 36 points which virtually guarantees them safety.

{"document": "At least three terror groups plotting attacks against Britain have changed their communication methods since the leaks by Edward Snowden, it was claimed last night. The Al Qaeda-linked networks have altered their tactics since the fugitive stole intelligence files from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, according to a report. Extremist websites have also moved to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programmes for followers, making it harder for extremists to be tracked down. Scroll down for video . Last Week Tonight host John Oliver flew to Moscow to grill Edward Snowden about the leaking of 'harmful' documents and asks him to explain why he did it . Evidence of the harm done to intelligence agencies across the world after the former CIA contractor leaked 1.7million classified documents in 2013 is compiled in the first comprehensive public analysis of the leaks by the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank. The Snowden files revealed details about covert attempts by agencies to view citizens' private information by gathering internet histories, emails, text and call records and passwords. Now the Henry Jackson Society has found that at least three Al Qaeda affiliates are known to have altered their communications. The think-tank has also found other groups using human couriers instead of email and mobile phones. Snowden fled justice in the US to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location . Jihadist websites also released three 'significant' encryption programmes 'within a three- to five-month time frame of the leaks', meaning fanatics are harder to detect and encrypted emails take longer to decipher. Report author Robin Simcox said: 'The focus has been about the so-called mass surveillance by GCHQ and the NSA but these leaks have allowed extremist groups and jihadists to look at our capabilities – what we can and can't do – which has given them a great insight. 'At a time when the range of threats against the West has never been greater, with Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Al Qaeda in Pakistan, it is astonishing the focus has been more on the shortcomings of our intelligence agencies and not the fact Snowden has helped terror suspects drop off the radar. 'He has caused severe damage to our ability to fight extremism.' MI5 director general Andrew Parker has called the traitor's actions a 'gift to terrorists'. On Monday, Snowden revealed he had not read all the top-secret dossiers he stole before handing them to newspapers including the Guardian – a move which has put lives in jeopardy from terrorists. He claims he had to act because the US and other Western governments' policies were a 'threat to democracy'.

{"document": "Crime and punishment: Erica Ginnetti, 35, has been sentenced to 30 days, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student . A disgraced Pennsylvania math teacher has been sentenced to 30 days in jail, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him X-rated photos. Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. The former math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland Township School District had been facing seven to 14 years in prison, but on Friday Judge Garrett Page sentenced her to 3-23 months, including the first 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest. She also faces three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service and will have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years, according to The Intelligencer. Ginneti’s jail terms begins April 10. In court Friday, Mrs Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.' Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions. The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge Garrett Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences. 'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated. He also chastised her for sending her male student explicit photos and videos of herself, which he likened to ‘dangling candy’ in front of the boy. The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her ‘bad act.’ Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . Ginneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car. She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter. Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.' When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said. Watch the full report on CBS Philly here. Two months after Ginnetti first met her 17-year-old victim at his prom in May 2013 they drove to an industrial park and had sex in her car .

Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning ‘a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti’s vehicle,’ according to the criminal complaint. On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to ‘do it again.’ As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.

An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. The current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck. Altamura is a city of Apulia, in southern Italy. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck . Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. Pictured is ‘Altamura Man's’ skull from different angles . Scientists assume he starved to death, or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life. Analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. The team say samples of DNA have also been retrieved from the sample, and because of the age, represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from Neanderthal remains. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. Separate research earlier this week found that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies .", "summary": "Altamura Man was discovered in a cave in 1993 in southern Italy .\nSkeleton's calcium formations suggest it is 128,000 to 187,000 years old .\nScientists have successful extracted DNA and are trying to sequence it .\nThey say DNA might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids ."}
{"document": "Tragedy: Dr. Frederic Brandt was battling with extreme depression before his suicide on Sunday a police report revealed on Tuesday . Fredric Brandt was suffering suicidal tendencies for just 10 days before he killed himself, revealed the police report into the tragic passing of the celebrity plastic surgeon. Brandt was discovered hanged inside the garage of his Coconut Grove home by his friend, John Joseph Hupert, at around 9.15am on Easter Sunday morning. According to the police report, Hupert was concerned for his friend and was staying with the doctor because he was suicidal. The last time Hupert said he had seen Brandt alive was around 11.30pm on Saturday. The police report says that Brandt's psychiatrist Dr. Saida Koita had become so worried for her patients state of mind that she ordered Hupert to stay with him to monitor him. She also revealed she had him on daily medication and was seeing him everyday for therapy sessions. The news that Brandt had descended into severe suicidal depression only very recently comes after claims that the 'Baron of Botox' killed himself after a 'bullying' TV series penned by Tina Fey aired on Netflix. The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt premiered on Netflix on March 6 and features a character called, Dr Franff. Played by comedian Martin Short, Franff has a high-pitched laugh, a speech impediment and absurd habits like drinking from a surgical bag. His face appears to be a grotesque exaggeration of Brandt's own appearance. Indeed, sources close to Brandt said the doctor, who suffered from depression, told People magazine he was 'definitely hurt' by an apparent portrayal of himself on the Netflix show. The friend called the Kimmy Schmidt send up 'bullying,' but added that it did not cause his suicide. Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show. A friend speaking to People said: 'It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying. '...It wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. It definitely hurt him. He was absolutely upset, who would want that? But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help. Scroll down for videos . Discovery: Dr. Brandt was found by a friend inside his home early on Sunday morning having taken his own life . Startling resemblance: Dr 'Franff' (played by Martin Short) – his name was Grant, but Franff is how he pronounced it due to all the surgery and injectables he’d presumably had - is lampooned in Tina Fey's Netflix show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Brandt worked with stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Jane Holzer. Left, the doctor is pictured with morning show host Kelly Ripa in 2011 at his Dr Fredric Brandt's SiriusXM launch and right, with comedian Joy Behar at the same event . Speaking out: Jeff Richmond, left in New York City today, spoke out on Monday over the death of Dr Fredric Brandt. The plastic surgeon was reportedly upset over his portrayal in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which Richmond's wife Tina Fey, right with Martin Short, created and for which Richmond has producing credits . Another source, speaking to the New York Daily News, said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients. The source said: 'He worked 15-hour days, his office was jam-packed, and I paid him a compliment. He was so sensitive he started to cry. He said how awful the public was, and how mean people are. He was really affected by negative feedback.' When DailyMail.com asked Tina Fey's husband Jeff Richmond about Brandt's death near his home in New York City's Upper West Side, he said he hadn't been aware of it. Richmond is an executive producer and music composer on his wife's show. He said: 'That's very sad. I don't know anything about it. I just got home. Tina might know, I don't. She's not home.' Brandt was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry, with high-profile stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Kelly Ripa. The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami where he lived alone with his dogs.

Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times.

Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt . Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma, The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality. The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Brandt grew up in Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments.", "summary": "Fredric Brandt had been suicidally depressed for 10 days before he took his own life .\nPolice report into the 65-year-old's suicide reveals Brandt was found on Sunday morning by friend, John Joseph Hupert, inside his garage .\nHupert was staying with the cosmetic surgeon on doctors orders to monitor Brandt's suicidal tendencies .\nHupert revealed that Brandt had been taking medication for his depression .\nParamedics declared the plastic surgeon dead at the scene after having found he hanged himself .\nBrandt's psychiatrist, Dr. Saida Koita, arrived soon afterwards and told police she had been treating Brandt daily .\nBrandt was reportedly devastated by parody character Dr Franff in hit Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt which debuted on March 6 .\nFriends said that, though Dr Brandt was upset, show didn't cause his death ."}
{"document": "Host commentator . Wow. Real Madrid haven't got going tonight (I was about to write a post about how Barcelona were 5-0 up at this point) but James Rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring. The ball bounces up to the Colombian who unleashes a stunning left-footed volley, dipping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner at some speed. That was very World Cup-esque, if you don't mind me saying. 39mins: As bad as Real have been, credit must go to Almeria. Their work rate has been exceptional while they are passing and moving, not exactly looking like a side who are  sitting just above the relegation zone. They have completed 184 passes so far today, which is a decent stat given it's not even half time yet. 31mins: But still, it's the visitors who are getting in behind more than Real. There are a few whistles in the crowd, and that's about the only atmosphere there is at this point. Things may get better now though, it's Ronaldo time again with the dead ball... but oh dear. That sums it all up, a limp effort rises way over the crossbar. 27mins: Uh oh. Free-kick time. James is clipped from 30 yards out and Ronaldo is licking his lips. Can he spark this game into life? Nearly! A swerving effort from left to right, the keeper is beaten but the ball doesn't quite dip in time and lands on the roof of the net. 24mins: Again, nice play from Almeria! Thomas, on loan from Atletico, shows his skills down the right before cutting the ball back for Corona, who fluffs his lines. Definitely a half chance for the visitors. Real need to wake up. 19mins: Considering the pace Barcelona were playing at last night this is pretty, er... slow. Real haven't found their rhythm yet while Almeria are just letting them pass from side to side. 15mins: Few more shots for the visitors, but they're both from around 25 yards and Keylor Navas won't be worried by those. Still, they're getting forward while leaving enough men back to fend against what could be a devastating counter attack. 12mins: Better from Almeria. They've won two out of their last three and are trying to bring some of that confidence into this one. Some sloppy passing from Illarramendi almost leads to a chance, as top scorer Hemed looks to get on the end of a cross. 7mins: Three shots already for the hosts, with Ronaldo having the latest two. No goals? Come on Cristiano! First, he runs at the Almeria defence but his left-footed strike is straight at the keeper who flicks it behind - and then from the resulting corner he rises highest but that's ballooned over the bar. 3mins: Almeria have quite a bit of the ball early on but unsurprisingly it's Real who almost force the opening. Javier Hernandez gets space down the left flank and his first time ball is just inches away from Cristiano Ronaldo at the back post. Soon after James meets Arbeloa's drilled cross from the right, but the goalkeeper can watch that one wide. Ominous signs for the visitors with all this space early on though... Away we go! Real Madrid kicking from left to right in the first half. The sun is shining at the Bernabeu, where Odegaard came out prior to kick-off to take a picture. Cute. Minutes until kick-off now, Madrid will be hoping to follow Barca's lead and turn on the style too. Both sets of players wearing 'Todos Con Nepal' t-shirts in support of the victims of the Nepal earthquake, and there will also be a minute's silence. Under the terms set out by Manchester United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. So, will he impress tonight? Real Madrid have scored 21 goals in their last four games against Almeria, including an 8-1 victory at the Bernabeu two years ago. Carlo Ancelotti has made nine changes tonight with  Iker Casillas, Dani Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo dropping out, though there is still place for Cristiano Ronaldo and Javier Hernandez. And on that note... Real Madrid: Navas, Arbeloa, Pepe, Varane, Coentrao, Kroos, Illarramendi, Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Jese, Hernandez . Subs: Casillas, Marcelo, Nacho, Lucas Silva, Isco, Odegaard, Mayoral . Almeria: Ruben, Ximo, Trujillo, Mauro, Mane, Verza, Thomas, Corona, Dubarbier, Hemed, Edgar . Subs: Julian, Casado, Jonathan, Sanchez, Espinosa, Marin, Azeez . Referee: Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva . It may only be a home clash against lowly Almeria, but tonight could be the biggest night of a 16-year-old's life. Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard has been named on the bench for this evening's La Liga game and may make his debut. Before that though, there is the small matter of Real closing the gap on archrivals Barcelona. Team news coming up. Pressure is on Real Madrid as they aim to narrow the five-point gap Barcelona have opened up at the top of La Liga. Barca hammered Getafe 6-0 on Tuesday to extend their lead at the La Liga summit, but Madrid will hope to reel in their rivals with victory over a struggling Almeria team.

{"document": "(CNN)38 and home. The Kentucky Wildcats' bid for perfection ended Saturday night at the hands of the Wisconsin Badgers, who rallied for a tough 71-64 victory in the NCAA men's basketball Final Four at Indianapolis. They will meet four-time national champ Duke in Monday night's title game. The Blue Devils dominated Michigan State 81-61 in the first contest of the night. National player of the year finalist Frank Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Junior forward Sam Dekker added 16 points. \"These guys just gutted it out.,\" Wisconsin Head Coach Bo Ryan said. \"We just kept battling on every possession.\" Freshman Karl-Anthony Towns led Kentucky with 16 points. Sophomore Andrew Harrison chipped in 13 points while Aaron Harrison had 12 points. Kentucky came into the game as the first men's team to have a 38-0 record. But the Badgers fought back from a 60-56 deficit with 6:39 left in the game. Wisconsin went on an 8-0 run to regain a lead it never relinquished. It will be looking to win its first title since 1941. As the final minutes ticked off, the Wildcats failed to score. They were stuck on 60 for five minutes. The Harrison twins, who shot well in the first half, couldn't get much done offensively. \"I didn't execute. I mean, we didn't execute as a team, but me being the point guard, I didn't do what coach told me to on a couple of occasions,\" Andrew Harrison said at the postgame news conference. His coach sternly interjected. \"He did fine. He did fine,\" John Calipari said. Meanwhile, Dekker stepped up, making a layup, a three-pointer and a free throw as the Badgers scooted ahead. Calipari said the Badgers did a good job defending the Kentucky big men. \"They crowded us a little bit, and (our) guys got a little tentative,\" he said. Calipari looked at the stat sheet: Kentucky had only six turnovers, hit 90% of its free throws, made 48% of its field goals, and lost. He said his team struggled to guard Wisconsin's players, and the rebound battle -- which Wisconsin won by 12 -- was crucial. Kamisky, who turned 22 on Saturday, was asked how the Badgers outrebounded a team that is the tallest in basketball. \"We stayed into them, attacking them, trying to do whatever we can,\" he said. \"Just trying to keep them off the glass was one of our main priorities.\" Freshman Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points while national freshman of the year Jahlil Okafor had 18 points, 10 of which came in the first half. Senior guard Quinn Cook had 17. \"The defense was terrific,\" Duke Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \"We drove the ball with such strength. I actually think our offense gave our defense a push.\" Junior guard Denzel Valentine sparked the Spartans with three early three-pointers and finished with 22 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. Senior guard Travis Trice had 16 points. The Spartans, of the Big Ten, began the game in a higher gear than Duke, and quickly took an eight-point lead. But after Valentine hit his trio of long-range shots and Michigan State led 14-6, the Spartans struggled to get baskets the rest of the first half. \"They did a good job of denying us and forcing us out (farther from the basket). We took some bad shots,\" Valentine said. Duke occasionally used a 2-3 zone defense that protected some of its players with foul concerns and slowed the Spartans down. But it was when Duke played man-to-man that the Spartans really had a hard time scoring. State made five of its first seven shots, then only made three more in the final 16 minutes of the opening half. The Blue Devils, of the Atlantic Coast Conference, found baskets inside as the 6-foot-11, 270-pound Okafor powered for points around the basket. Winslow used his quickness to score seven points in the first half, but he only played 12 minutes because he committed two fouls. Duke led at halftime 36-25, a turnaround of 19 points from its early deficit. \"Coach always stresses that great defense leads to great offense,\" Cook said. The confidence gained in getting defensive stops led to the desire for Duke players to drive the lane instead of shooting three-pointers. \"We saw seams that we could take advantage of,\" Cook said. In the second half, Duke increased its lead to 20 points, then cruised home. The Spartans were never able to cut the deficit to single digits and Duke sank its free throws in the final minutes. \"We got beat and ...  Duke played awfully well, but I thought it wasn't one of our better games,\" Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo said. The Blue Devils apparently like playing in Final Fours in Indianapolis, home of the NCAA. It won titles there in 1991 and 2010. The other two crowns came in 1992 and 2001, each in Minneapolis. Duke has beaten Wisconsin this season, 80-70 in Wisconsin in December. If Duke wins Monday night, it would tie Indiana and North Carolina for third-most NCAA championships with five.", "summary": "Wisconsin, which last won a title in 1941, was led by birthday boy Frank Kaminsky .\nJustise Winslow leads Duke with 19 points, while Jahlil Okafor has 18 .\nCoach K says his team's defense was \"terrific\""}

District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said on Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit.

Weinstein, who always maintained his innocence, could have faced misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations proved true.

{"document": "Gone are the days of the waif model and 'heroin chic': a new, fitter, stronger generation of women will be walking down the runway at this year's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. We Are Handsome will  debut their first Active Swim range on Tuesday night in Sydney and break all the rules by featuring real-life fitness and social media stars, rather than professional models. The models will include Sjana Earp,  Kate Kendall, Amanda Bisk, Juliet Burnett, and Lindy Klim. Scroll down for video . Bringing sexy back: Australian designers We Are Handsome are among the fashion houses rejecting traditional skinnier models in favour of strong, fit girls . Earp, 20, is a social media sensation famous for sharing her yoga poses with her 679,000 Instagram followers, Bisk is a former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter, sprinter and yogi, Kendall is a qualified yoga instructor and Burnett is a professional Australian Ballet dancer. We Are Handsome design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers,  are known for pushing boundaries but believe there will be only positive reaction to their unusual model choice. 'There’s a big thing about \"who should be on the runway\" so we know we’re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before (and who are nervous about it),' Katinka told Daily Mail Australia. Strong beats skinny: We Are Handsome will debut fit, real girls (including Instagram sensation Sjana Earp, pictured) at launch of their Active Swim range on Tuesday night in Sydney . Bolt like Bisk: Amanda Bisk, who is the ultimate fit trifecta, (yogi, pole vaulter and sprinter), will also walk the runway show today . Beach to backstage: Bisk achieves her slim frame through healthy exercise . 'But the rules are there to be broken, times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape. Strong really is the new sexy.' Casting healthy girls is crucial  to the designers who believe   largely represent their brand and  promote the active philosophy they value. 'We will not cast skinny models or skeletal frames, we look for real, active and healthy women - and  not just with the fit girls but for our catwalk models too,' says Katinka. Waif goes wayward: Australian designers ditch skeletal frames, following France's law to ban skinny models . En pointe: Ballet dancer Juliet Burnett will feature as one of the fit girls in the We Are Handsome show . Jeremy admits personality comes into it too. 'We're authentic, fun and outgoing so it's about making people feel good and having girls that purvey that.' 'A lot of the girls (fitness models) are very big on Instagram and encourage people to follow in their active foot steps, so we have chosen experienced yogis, a ballerina, a sprinter and pole vaulter and people who embody healthy eating too,' says Jeremy. On how the industry will take their bold choice, the We Are Handsome couple aren't worried. Klim-spiration: Lindy Klim, pictured wearing a We Are Handsome swimsuit, will also walk the runway . 'We have friends who are competitors, but we don’t design for other designers, we design for ourselves and the We Are Handsome woman,' says Jeremy. 'We're also not shunning skinny women,' adds Katinka. 'There are lots of women out there that no matter what they eat, won’t be a robust shape. We're just aiming for a different shape of women to other designers.' This industry first in Australia comes only days after  France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Aspirational athlete: Kate Kendall, co-owner of  gym Flow Athletic will host a yoga class and walk the runway . Agents and fashion houses who hire the models could  face fines under the new law, which was passed on April 3. 'We're also not shunning skinny women,' adds Katinka. 'There are lots of women out there that no matter what they eat, won’t be a robust shape. We're just aiming for a different shape of women to other designers.' This industry first in Australia comes only days after  France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Social media star: Sjana Earp, fitness blogger and avid yogi will star in the We Are Handsome show . This self-regulated approach has also been taken by new Australian brand Robb & Lulu who cast healthy, Instagram sensation Renee Somerfield for their debut collection. 'After the collection went live online yesterday we had great consumer and industry feedback,' says Sian Vandermuelen who represents the label. 'They loved that we were using a woman that wasn't a typical sample size and who is comfortable in her own skin.' Crave comfort: Robb & Lulu have found women like seeing models who are comfortable in their own skin . Leading the way in size range too, Robb & Lulu have chosen to make resort wear that goes from size 0 up to 26 and swimwear that includes bigger cup sizes too, with cups sizes going up to a double F. 'Lulu found there was a gap in market and she needed to design for women that are bigger and bustier and people that were able to feel empowered and comfortable in a bigger bikini or kaftan.' And the proof is in the demand, with British Vogue already catching wind of the label's range and requesting stock from them based on their fits and ability to suit all bodies and sizes. Australian designer Manning Cartell have also taken a stance, with all 39 women on their runway being size 8-10 models this season. Bikini babe: Social media star Renee Somerfield was chosen to launch Robb & Lulu's first collection . Push for plus: Australian label Robb and Lulu have had great response to 0-26 size range and FF cup sizes .

Additionally Bondi Bather has refused 'too-skinny models' during castings with designer Kerry Cusack reporting back to modelling agencies that she is after healthy, Aussie girls and believes its a responsibility designers need to guard to stop young girls body image issues.

The 27-year-old Scot has lost his last seven matches to the Serb, this one the Miami Open final 7-6 4-6 6-0 on a brutally punishing afternoon, suffering the undeserving ignominy of conceding another love set against his old rival. He pushed him hard and had enough early chances to have won it in straight sets. In fact Murray pushed Djokovic so hard that, at the end of the second set, the furious Serb wrenched his towel off a startled ballkid and screamed at his box on his way to the chair, gaining a warning as his mask of statesmanship slipped.

Murray has had a good enough week to walk down the aisle with Kim Sears having got back to world No 3, but it is now ten out of eleven defeats against the world No 1. How to seize the moment against this phenomenal competitor is a hugely pressing issue for him and everyone else. As for Djokovic, he will now be holding that distinction for the 141st week of his career on Monday, putting him on sixth equal in the all-time list with Rafael Nadal. In some ways this was a truncated version of their Australian Open final. A forlorn Murray reflected afterwards: 'Game wise, I feel like in the couple of the matches we played this year I've been able to hang with him, but just not quite for long enough unfortunately.

I played well for two sets and was struggling physically in the third. I don't feel like I can do loads more than what I'm doing to get myself in the best condition possible, I do push myself very hard.' The first set was notable for Murray's early aggression that brought him a break in the third game and should have seen him open up a 3-1 lead. But it transpired that it was desperately difficult playing into the fierce lunchtime sun. Nobody actually held at the city end of the court until the eleventh game when the Serb managed it.

Murray became more and more agitated as he failed to gain the breakthrough but held on until 5-4 when Djokovic dissolved into a ball of Balkan anger. Murray broke him to love and the Serb angrily snatched his towel off the ballboy, apologising later: ' I'm sorry, because I didn't pay attention to the ball boy and I just screamed at my box,' he said.

{"document": "A man stuck by a serious bowel infection has been cured after undergoing a faecal transplant, with stools donated by his daughter. Len Barnes shed three stone as he battled the life-threatening condition Clostridium difficile, suffering bouts of diarrhoea. He lost his appetite and endured continuous pain. Despite numerous courses of antibiotics during long spells in hospital, the 75-year-old was showing no signs of improvement. It was then that specialists suggested a faecal transplant. Len Barnes, 57, from Stockton, has been cured of the severe bowel infection Clostridium difficile after undergoing a faecal transplant. His daughter Debbie, left, acted as donor . 'I'd never heard of it before,' said Mr Barnes. 'I thought, \"come on, you're taking the mickey\". 'But my doctor explained that mixing healthy poo with my poo - and transferring it back into my bowel mixed with warm water - would give someone's healthy bacteria the chance to fight with my bad bacteria. And when gastroenterologist Chris Wells raised the issue of finding a suitable donor, Mr Barnes' daughter Debbie stepped in. The 52-year-old's stools were tested to ensure they were suitable and free from harmful bacteria. Mr Barnes, from Stockton, was then admitted to the University Hospital of North Tees. The procedure aims to re-balance the bacteria in the gut, by introducing bacteria from the faeces of healthy people. Once Ms Barnes' stools were approved, they were mixed with water and filtered. The solution was then transplanted into Mr Barnes' gut via an endoscope - a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end. 'I had a bit of sedation but watched it all happening on the screen in the endoscopy unit,' he said. Gastroenterologist Dr Chris Wells performed the procedure at the University Hospital of North Tees . 'I was interesting. I knew it had worked straight away. 'The next day Dr Wells said I could go home and everything was back to normal.' Dr Wells, said: 'Faecal transplantation doesn't sound very appealing but it's a very effective remedy in patients like Len. 'Transplanting faeces from one person to another does seem a bit unusual but actually it's using healthy gut bacteria to fight off infection. 'Our bowels are packed full of billions of bacteria and these play an important role in maintaining health.' Dr Wells said there had been a significant reduction in the number of C-diff cases in the trust over the past few years but it was reassuring to know that faecal transplant was now an option to treat the condition. In March last year the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published new guidelines, naming faecal transplants as a recognised form of treatment for C-diff infections. Experts deemed the procedure is 'safe enough to be used in the NHS'. An analysis of seven studies, involving 558 patients, revealed nearly all patients were cured. In one study, the infection came back in around one in 20 patients within five weeks, compared with more than half of the patients given antibiotics. In another study, the infection came back in around one in 50 patients between 29 days and four years after faecal transplant. Nice concluded it didn't make much difference if the transplant was from a relative or stranger, or if the transplant had been frozen or not.", "summary": "Len Barnes, 75, lost three stone while battling clostridium difficile .\nWhen antibiotics failed to work specialists suggested a faecal transplant .\nMr Barnes' daughter Debbie stepped in to help, and donated her stools ."}
{"document": "Ben Jones-Bishop scored a spectacular solo try as the Salford Red Devils ended a run of 17 defeats in a row by Wigan after a thrilling 24-18 contest which saw both players finish with 12 men. Jones-Bishop, snapped up from Leeds Rhinos in the close-season, extended his lead as Salford's leading scorer with his seventh of the campaign. The Red Devils were hanging onto a 12-8 interval lead when Jones-Bishop struck on the hour to help his club leapfrog the Warriors into third place in the table. Both sides ended the match with 12 men as tempers flared during the Super League match . But Salford forward Weller Hauraki, already facing a ban after an incident at Huddersfield in Friday, and John Bateman were sent off two minutes from time for trading punches after the pair had already been sin binned following an earlier flare up. Salford's last win against Wigan was a 16-4 Challenge Cup fifth-round victory at the Willows in 2006. The long-awaited victory was particularly sweet for the the three former Wigan players in the Red Devils ranks - Scott Taylor, skipper Harrison Hansen and try scorer Michael Dobson. Dobson was outstanding and also helped set up two tries for full-back Niall Evalds. Salford brought in Evalds to replace full-back Kevin Locke who was concussed at Huddersfield. Wigan again left out Matty Bowen with Ryan Hampshire continuing at full-back and Lewis Tierney replacing Dom Manfredi on the wing. Conor Farrell, younger brother of second row Liam, also stepped into the squad with Joel Tomkins missing. Wigan Warriors' Michael McIlorum is tackled by Salford Red Devils's Liam Hood  and Weller Hauraki . Salford organised a reunion of their 1996 side, which famously ended Wigan's record-breaking Challenge Cup run, with the players and then coach Andy Gregory introduced to the fans before the kick-off. But the kick-off was delayed 15 minutes due to crowd congestion outside the AJ Bell Stadium. Wigan would have snatched an early lead had Tierney not slipped when Jones-Bishop spilled a George Williams kick. Salford's relief was short-lived when their defence failed to deal with another towering Matty Smith kick and Larne Patrick picked up the loose ball to stroll over for his first try for the club since his move from Huddersfield. Hampshire tagged on the conversion with the Red Devils forced to make an early substitution when Tommy Lee hobbled off after 11 minutes to be replaced by Liam Hood. A storming break by Josh Griffin put Wigan under pressure for the first time with Joe Burgess forced to make a try-saving tackle on Rangi Chase. But Salford suffered another injury blow midway through the first half when Cory Paterson was helped off with a knee problem. Wigan increased the lead to 8-0 with a Hampshire penalty after Weller Hauraki was caught offside from a Smith kick. The Red Devils hit back with Dobson and Chase combining for Evalds to dart over with Josh Griffin adding the conversion. Wigan lost Tony Clubb with a thigh injury before Salford took the lead for the first time with a sizzling try from Dobson against his old club. Josh Griffin broke clear from inside his own half for the supporting Dobson to notch his first try for the club with Griffin tagging on the goal to make it 12-8. The bumper crowd generated a tremendous atmosphere and the Red Devils fans were cheering again with a blistering burst from his own line by Evalds after gathering a Williams kick. Then Jones-Bishop grabbed a superb solo try on the hour to fire his side into an 18-8 lead. There appeared to be no danger to Wigan when Jones-Bishop took the ball 45 metres out. But he burst through two tackles and then rounded Hampshire in style to notch his seventh try of the season with Griffin converting. The hard-fought contest erupted 15 minutes from time with referee Richard Silverwood sin-binning Hauraki and Bateman after a melee. Hampshire put Wigan right back in the thrilling match with a fine try after 68 minutes and also added the goal to cut the gap to 18-14.

Vera Baird donated £500,000 to Victims First Northumbria, a charity which supports crime victims in her area and of which she is a director. Sitting alongside her on the organisation's top table is Sue Sim, Northumbria's Chief Constable, records revealed. The pair now face a Ministry of Justice probe as critics accuse them of concocting 'a soap opera' within the force. Vera Baird, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, faces a Ministry of Justice investigation after allocating more than £500,00 of public money to a charity of which she is the director . Sitting alongside Ms Baird on Victims First Northumbria's top table is Chief Constable Sue Sim. The pair are pictured together, above . It comes after the Home Secretary implemented a rule allowing PCCs to commission services for victims of crime. Last month Ms Baird boasted of the securing of funds for the charity in an article on its website. 'From April 1, I become responsible for some victims’ services after funding was devolved by the Ministry of Justice to PCCs,' she wrote. A Northumbria Police spokesman said the funds would be allocated 'in the same manner that Victim Support were directly funded by the MOJ'. But critics have described her selection of charity as 'inappropriate' and a conflict of interest. Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs committee, said: 'Northumbria police appears to have developed its own soap opera. 'It is totally inappropriate for a PCC to set up any organisation in which they have an interest of whatever kind using public money.' In an article on the charity's website, Ms Baird boasted of securing the funds from the public purse last month . Mrs Sim shot to prominence within the force over her handling of the hunt for Raoul Moat in 2010. She is pictured above with Deputy Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson at a press conference following his death . Adding the fact that Chief Constable Sue Sim was 'wrong', Mr Vaz said commissioners should never have been given the ability to allocate public funds to charity. 'The Home Secretary should never have given these powers.' Ms Baird stood by her decision today, telling MailOnline: 'All Ministry of Justice procedures and protocols were adhered to. Keith Vaz accused the force of creating its own 'soap opera' 'I am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create Victims First Northumbria were the right ones.' Mrs Sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in June. She was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by Ms Baird, her co-director at Victims First Northumbria. A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken. 'The MoJ requires PCCs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established.' Victims First Northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor, Victim Support, plummeted. But sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by Mrs Sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week. The police chief who shot to prominence after her handling of the Raoul Moat manhunt in 2010, said she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. Ms Baird praised her 'passion and enthusiasm', adding: 'Sue and I have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since I became police and crime commissioner.'", "summary": "Vera Baird has allocated £500,000 to be given to Victims First Northumbria .\nPolice and Crime Commissioner is a director at the newly set-up charity .\nChief Constable Sue Sim is also on the organisation's board of directors .\nCritics have accused Northumbria Police of creating 'its own soap opera'"}

The Blues had a good shout for an early penalty when Oscar was clipped by Bellerin but I agreed with Oliver that the contact was accidental and minimal - a penalty would have been very harsh. Oliver was more decisive when Cesc Fabregas went to ground after feeling contact from Santi Cazorla. The fall was exaggerated and theatrical and that might have influenced Oliver as he cautioned the Spaniard for simulation. Chelsea should have had a penalty when Brazilian forward Oscar nicked the ball past David Ospina . The Arsenal goalkeeper clattered Oscar, who was left with a possible concussion and replaced at half time . Replays proved that to be incorrect as they showed slight contact on Fabregas' knee - perhaps not enough for a penalty but certainly enough contact to make the caution incorrect. Arsenal had an appeal of their own when the ball span up and caught Gary Cahill on the arm but again I thought Oliver was right as Cahill was very close to the Arsenal player and his arm was not in an unnatural position. There was only one clear penalty for me when Oscar was played clean through on goal and lobbed David Ospina the Arsenal keeper clearly wiped Oscar out and Oliver should have given them a penalty. Oliver may well have been waiting to see if Oscar's lob went in the goal but once it was cleared he should have gone back, awards the penalty and cautioned Ospina. Oscar had gone down earlier in the half under the slightest of contact from Hector Bellerin . Cesc Fabregas was booked after appearing to kick his leg out to find contact from Santi Cazorla .

{"document": "A controversial anti-vaccination organisation has come under fire for comparing compulsory vaccination to rape in a social media post. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network, an anti-vaccinations lobby group, posted an image to their Facebook page on Thursday which shows a man holding a woman with his hand over her mouth in an aggressive silencing gesture. The tag line on the image read, 'Forced penetration. Really- no big deal, if it's just a vaccination needle and he's a doctor. Do you really \"need\" control over over your own choices?'. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has come under fire for comparing vaccinations to rape . The image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April, which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. However, a president of the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network said the message had nothing to do with the group. 'I can state categorically that The Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network Inc does not support or agree with the sentiments or messages portrayed in the picture,' she said. 'We do not own the page it was posted on.' 'What the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network does support and believe in, is the right of ALL parents to make an informed choice in regards to vaccinating their children, whether they vaccinate, selectively vaccinate or do not vaccinate at all,' she said. 'We are pro-choice, pro-information and pro-parental rights. The new federal law, which was in part prompted by the death of one-month-old Riley Hughes from complications arising from whooping cough, means that parents who refuse to immunise their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016. The post, which has since been removed, caused an instant outcry from followers and opponents of the group alike, with social media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault. 'Dear rape victims, according to the rabid anti-vaxxers what you went thru is no worse than. Shame,' said one social media user. 'Are you saying that your child being immunised is as bad as your child being raped? This could also be very triggering for victims of sexual assault,' said another. The administrator of the page defended the post, maintaining that is wasn't tasteless, but honest. 'What truly is tasteless is our elected government trying to tell us that we have to vaccinate our children even if we don’t believe it is best for their health,' the administrator wrote. 'That is tasteless. And if you find this post confronting – imagine how you would feel if you were a parent who was being told that they were going to have to vaccinate their children or starve.'

The image was posted in response to tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws which was announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April .

'As written in the about section, the AVN has not owned this Facebook page for some time. This page is open to the public. We sincerely apologise for an earlier post that caused offense to many, including supporters. We are still investigating and have taken your comments on board,' the post said. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations, when reports of a child being given a court order to be immunised was labelled by the group as 'court ordered rape'. 'Think this is an exaggeration? Think again. This is assault without consent and with full penetration too,' the post said. 'If you were the doctor ordered to administer this vaccine and the mother was standing there, holding her child under a court order while you prepared the shot and she was begging you to stop and crying that it would hurt and you continued to do it anyway - how different is that from rape?' the administrator later commented on the post.

{"document": "Crime gangs from Eastern Europe are operating here with 'impunity' due to EU free movement rules, a disturbing report warns today. Human traffickers run huge benefit frauds in the UK, including one that was used to fund a housing development in Slovakia. The vile trade also includes the sale of young girls for prostitution and sham marriages. In some cases, 'customers' from outside the EU are requesting women with EU passports so they can make them pregnant. The migrants – desperate for a foothold in Britain – then claim they have a human right to a family life in the UK to raise the child. Vicious: A menacing Eastern European gang leader with his Rottweiler. Crime gangs from Eastern Europe are operating here with 'impunity' due to EU free movement rules, a disturbing report warns today . The Centre for Social Justice report, written by a former senior aide to Home Secretary Theresa May, is based on interviews with senior police and officials in Britain and overseas. It offers a deeply disturbing insight into how, since the EU expanded to include former Eastern Bloc members in 2004, a huge market has opened up in what it calls the 'modern slave trade'. In the past, trafficking gangs had to bring in migrants from outside the EU – which meant they would need to pass through border controls. But they are now able to target people in impoverished communities in Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria with open access to Britain. Migrants are duped into believing they are travelling to the UK for work and enter the country legally under the EU's Free Movement Directive. The traffickers then seize control of their bank accounts and travel documents, and force them to work in often gruesome conditions. The report, written by former Home Office special adviser Fiona Cunningham, says: 'One of the most serious unintended consequences of free movement in the EU is that it has made it much easier for organised criminal gangs to operate their cross-border business models with impunity and without fear of being detected and therefore pursued.' Significantly, the report has the backing of Mrs May, who has written the foreword. She has been one of the Cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on EU free movement – including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of Britain. Limits: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, has been one of the Cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on EU free movement – including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of Britain . The report also warns of Eastern European girls – aged 15 to 25 – being brought to Britain and forced into prostitution, benefit fraud or sham weddings to Asian men seeking a right to remain in the UK. Manchester, Birmingham and Gretna are identified as hotspots – with Scotland targeted so the victims can marry at a younger age. Shockingly, the report found girls were sold to 'customers' for pregnancy so the buyer could claim he had an article 8 right to a family life in the UK. Europol, the EU's crime fighting agency, has identified particular problems with children being brought into the UK from Slovakia. Voters want the Tories to be far tougher on mass immigration, a major survey revealed last night. Barely one in ten Britons say they are satisfied with David Cameron’s border policies. The poll by Ipsos MORI suggests this unhappiness may explain why large numbers of Conservatives are switching to Ukip. The findings will heap pressure on the Prime Minister to end his silence on immigration during the election campaign. He has not mentioned his party’s manifesto pledges to curb EU free movement, deport more illegals and tag foreign criminals. Yet a large proportion of voters believe politicians are talking too little about migration. Blow for Cameron: A new Ipsos MORI survey reveals the huge levels of dissatisfaction with the Government's handing of immigration, especially among former Tory supporters who now plan to vote Ukip . Major issue: Just 12 per cent of all voters are satisfied with the handling of immigration, falling to just 1 per cent of Ukip supporters. Above, charts based on results from the Ipsos MORI survey . They are kept under the influence of drink and drugs, to make them easier to control, then sold for sex. Police in Kent said that, in a single day, 16 such children were taken into care. The report adds: 'Pregnant women are sometimes recruited and forced to sell their babies.' Action: Mr Cameron has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by EU nationals . Romania and Hungry were also identified as countries from which criminal gangs are trafficking women for sex. Women who are brought to the UK and forced to work in the sex industry are often moved from city to city, with their services advertised online. One website featured 1,000 women based in London. The report calls on the EU to implement a new system of passenger name records so there is a better chance of tracking people smugglers and their victims who travel by air. But this is being blocked by the EU on privacy grounds. It would also alert the authorities if a suspected people smuggler was headed towards the UK with a child. The report says: 'Exploiting the internet and borders made less defined due to European Union policies like free movement, organised crime groups find the trafficking of victims a highly lucrative and accessible crime.' The Home Office has estimated that, in any given year, there are between 10,000 and 13,000 victims of human trafficking in the UK. In the last Parliament, the Tories passed Europe's first Modern Slavery Act. Traffickers involved in the most serious cases now face possible life sentences. David Cameron has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by EU nationals. In November 2013, he announced new rules stipulating that incomers can receive out-of-work benefits only once they have been living in the country for three months. UK benefits scam builds a Slovak village . By Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent for the Daily Mail . A crime gang from Slovakia duped unsuspecting families into travelling to the UK so they could scam hundreds of thousands of pounds in benefits – and send the cash back to a village known as 'Smartie Town'. The profits were funnelled to the 1,000-year-old village of Pavlovce nad Uhom in the Michalove district of Slovakia where they were used to build houses. The homes are partly funded by the UK taxpayer and local residents have nicknamed them 'Smarties' after the chocolate sweets because the houses are painted brightly and in different colours. Vivid: A house in so-called Smartie Town, where a crime gang funnelled profits from a benefits scam. Homes in the 1,000-year-old village, such as the one pictured above, are partly funded by the UK taxpayer . When the gang feared UK officials might become suspicious, they changed tactics – sending the migrants to Canada instead to claim asylum and state support there. The victims, expecting to work legally, had been transported to Britain in coaches. But once they were across the border, the criminals seized their passports and other documents and forced them into domestic servitude, slave labour and welfare fraud – signing up for several state handouts including tax credits. Gang members arranged housing and took their victims to open high street bank accounts using a 'translator' who was also in on the lucrative scam. Benefits were then paid into accounts in the names of the victims but controlled by the traffickers. Scam: Three Slovakian crooks, including Darina Balogova, pictured, raked in £1.2million by bringing 'fake mothers' to Britain to claim benefits falsely . The sums of money made by the Eastern Europeans from trafficking victims using this kind of exploitation were huge. In another case, three Slovakian con artists raked in £1.2million by bringing 'fake mothers' to Britain to claim benefits falsely. They persuaded women from their home country to live in the UK and fraudulently claim child and working tax benefits. The family splashed the vast amounts of cash they pocketed on a life of luxury, gambling in casinos and going on spending sprees to buy gold and diamonds. The crooks – Darina Balogova, her husband Marek Balog, and brother Jaroslav Bado – pulled off one of the largest welfare scams of its kind from a terraced house in Chatham, Kent. Up to 50 women were brought to Britain under freedom of movement rules and groomed to claim falsely that they were working for a temp agency on low wages so they could receive tax credits. After the gang had exploited the identities of the women, they allowed them to return to Slovakia, retaining control of their bank accounts, passports, national insurance cards and birth certificates. Balogova – who never worked a day after arriving in Britain – kept around £30,000 in cash at their headquarters in nearby Rochester. At least £60,000 in stolen benefits were transferred back home. But the scam was finally exposed when the criminals began using a high street stationer's receipt books to write bogus payslips for the women. HM Revenue & Customs inspectors noticed they were using the same employee number on all the slips. In November 2011, at Maidstone Crown Court the gang were jailed for tax credit fraud and money laundering. Balogova was sentenced to four-and-a-half years, while Balog was given three-and-a-half years and Bado three years.

Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans.

The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals.

{"document": "A burlesque performer is attempting to eradicate all negativity surrounding the word 'fat' – by embracing it as an honest, body-positive description of her own physique. During a recent TED talk, Lillian Bustle, from New Jersey, revealed that she also calls herself 'short', because she is 5'3'', and 'wife', because she is married, noting that each of these words is just an honest description of what she is. And 'fat' is just another self-descriptor for her, who insists that the word doesn't have to be used as a synonym for 'ugly'. 'We as women are programmed to tell each other that we're not fat, because to many people - both men and women - fat is the worst thing that you can be,' she said during her talk, which took place earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Not-so-tiny dancer: Burlesque performer Lillian Bustle explained in her TED talk that 'fat' is just another word - and using it doesn't have to be an insult . Beauty comes in bigger packages, too: During her lecture, Lillian explained that 'fat' shouldn't mean the same thing as ugly . Unfortunately, Lillian added, her worldview isn't held by everyone, and she pointed to a statistic that shows that size discrimination in the workplace has risen 66 per cent in the past 30 years. And those negative perceptions of bigger people start young: The top 'magic wish' for girls 11 to 17, according to a study, is to be thinner. But there's hope. Lillian explained that, according to other studies, 'the more we're exposed to body diversity, the more we tolerate, accept, and yes, even prefer, different body types'. That promising fact is something that encourages the dancer to perform burlesque, which enables her to expose her audiences to a 'fat' body in a positive, glamorous way. Changing minds: Studies show that the more people are exposed to different body types, the more they like them; Lillian hopes exposing her audience to a fuller figure will change their perceptions . Lillian also quoted another performer named Beelzebabe, who has spoken out in the past about the fact that the body diversity of burlesque performers 'challenges us to rethink the narrow confines that society has given us for what's desirable'. It certainly challenged Lillian, who weighs in at 240lbs. She admits she was in awe at the first burlesque show she ever saw, immediately resolving to try it herself. She began performing in 2012, and says the experience has been both empowering and incredibly body-positive. While the first time she performed she was nervous about people seeing her arms jiggle, once she did it, she felt like she could 'walk through fire'. Now, whenever she's feeling insecure, she can think back to that first performance; Lillian recommends other people find a similar 'courage reference' - a moment you felt brave that you can think back to at times when you feel more insecure and afraid. Self-esteem boost: Lillian said she was nervous before her first performance because of how her arms looked, but now she feels great about her body . Plump crowd-pleaser: While a few people have left nasty comments on the YouTube page for her TED talk, Lillian said the response has been mostly positive . Though Lillian gave her TED talk in 2014, it was only posted on YouTube three weeks ago. Since then, the clip has generated nearly 38,000 views - and plenty of positive feedback. 'I’ve never been so happy in all my life,' she wrote for xoJane. 'I’ve had this stupid grin on my face for a week straight.' Besides a few 'trolls' posting vicious negative comments, Lillian received a slew of positive messages, including letters of thanks, personal stories, and an email from a teenage girl who watched the video with her younger sister and said it made them reevaluate the way they viewed their bodies. 'I really think we - and by \"we\" I mean nice people and body-positivity - are winning,' she said.", "summary": "At 240lbs, Lillian Bustle says she's not being negative when she calls herself 'fat' - she is just being factual .\nShe says she likes performing burlesque because it helps open people up to liking different body types .\nThe dancer says she's thrilled at the positive reception her TED talk has received, adding that she believes it means 'body-positivity' is working ."}

{"document": "(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport.

{"document": "A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal Wednesday to avoid a trial, sobbing as she accepted the agreement in court. One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students . Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month . Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, ‘Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?’ Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial . Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having sex with three boys . Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on  bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal.", "summary": "Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students .\nOne victim testified that he considered married teacher to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst .\nTwo of the boys have filed lawsuits against school district for failing to fire Altice .\nEach criminal count against teacher carries 1 to 15 years in prison ."}

{"document": "Stone Age man ate mushrooms as part of their diet, a study on ancient tooth plaque has revealed. Anthropologists studying the remains of a prehistoric woman nicknamed The Red Lady of El Mirón have found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth. Discovered in an elaborate grave in the El Mirón cave in Cantabria, Spain, the remains are thought to belong to a 35 to 40-year-old woman who was buried around 18,700 years ago. The images above show some of the microscopic fungal spores from grilled fungi (left) and bolete fungi (right) that the researchers found trapped inside the hardened dental plaque on the Red Lady of El Mirón's teeth . The study now provides the oldest evidence yet that mushrooms were eaten by early humans and helps to shed new light on the mysterious Red Lady. Her body was found in 2010 in the cave stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers with an engraved stone nearby. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. Her robust skeleton, which bore few signs of disease, and her elaborate funeral suggests she may have been of high status or even buried in a sacrificial ritual. Now the research looking at the dental calculus - hardened plaque - has helped to shed some light on her diet. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found her teeth bore the remains of plant pollen, fungi and animals. They found microscopic evidence that the woman had been eating sponge capped, bolete mushrooms and gilled mushrooms from the Agaric group. The researchers also found her teeth bore little signs of decay, suggesting she ate few carbohydrates. Robert Power, who led the research, said: 'These types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants from different environments, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'This finding at El Mirón Cave could be the earliest indication of human mushroom use or consumption, which until this point has been unidentified in the Palaeolithic.' Agaric muchrooms include the distinctive red and white spotted fly agaric, which is poisonous but also has halucinogenic qualities. However, the group includes many common forms of mushroom that are harmless. Bolete mushrooms include Boletus edulis, which is also called porchini. There is some evidence from neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Piedmont in the Italian Alps that suggest psychotropic mushrooms were used in rituals. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of El Mirón Cave, which lies between Santander and Bilbao. This plant fragment was discovered in the hardened plaque on the teeth of the Red Lady of El Mirón . The Red Lady was discovered in the El Mirón Cave in 2000 at a site that has been excavated since 1996 . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings but the Red Lady was found covered in the substance when her remains were discovered . After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal which as has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. The entrance to the El Mirón Cave (above) is located in the mountainous region of eastern Cantabria in Spain . The Red Lady was found in an elaborate grave (pictured) and is thought to have been buried 18,700 years ago . Anthropologists who have studied the Red Lady's remains believe she was buried in a tightly bundled fetal position on her left side with her chest facing the cave wall and her back towards a large stone block . The fact she was buried within in what appears to be living quarters has suggested she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. A primative tombstone found nearby also hints at this. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. There is some evidence that the people living in the cave at the time ate large amounts of meat from red deer and ibex but there are few signs of what role plants played in their diet. Mr Power and Dr Amanda Henry, whose work is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined samples of the plaque from the Red Lady's teeth in an attempt to learn more about her. They found chemical signitures that indicate she may have eaten seeds, roots and other plants with low levels of starch. The Fly agaric (above) is one of the most easily recognised  gill mushrooms which formed the Red Lady's diet . The researchers also found the remains of pollen from pine trees and spores from the fungi. It is possible the fungi had been used to help flavour food or as a medicine. The Tryolean Iceman 'Otzi' - who lived around 3,000 years ago - was found to be carrying several types of fungi. Writing in the journal, Mr Power and his colleagues said their findings had shed new light on prehistoric diet of the Red Lady. They said: 'The types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants, including seeds and underground storage organs, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'These findings suggest that plant and plant-like foods were parts of her diet, supplementing staples derived from animal foods.' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria.", "summary": "Anthropologists studied the teeth of a prehistoric woman nicknamed the Red Lady who was found in the El Mirón cave in eastern Cantabria, Spain .\nThe plaque showed signs of plant pollen and several mushroom spores .\nIt is the earliest evidence for humans eating mushrooms yet discovered .\nResearchers say the mushrooms may have flavoured the Red Lady's diet ."}

Speaking to Bleacher Report, Popovic said: 'His potential was amazing, I didn't see for a long time such an intelligent player like Muto. He's a different guy, he's not such a usual player. 'Muto is something like a noble. He has something different to all other players because he comes from a good family, he has good education, he was at university. A very smart, intelligent guy. He has something which you cannot learn. 'He was so fast. So speedy and, for a Japanese guy, so strong. And also so confident. He has a lot of confidence. In our training games Muto always had chances. Amazing. He had 10 or 12 chances in every game.' Muto says he is still considering a move to Chelsea as he wants to join a club where he will 'play and develop' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had admitted that he is aware of the Japan international . Chelsea signed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama Rubber in February and Jose Mourinho has admitted that commercial interests do play a part in the club's transfer policy. Asked about Muto earlier this month, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play.

{"document": "A husband convicted of beating his wife to death after she filed for divorce has been sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity. The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence. James Robarge (above pictured in court last month), 45, of Vermont was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison . Robarge was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge . The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this . Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News. In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.' One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom. 'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday . During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge . And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years . Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.", "summary": "James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning .\nHe was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge .\nRobarge has already served two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years ."}

'Most of the players are fit but being fit for me is different,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie will not return to the fray for Manchester United  against Manchester City on Sunday .

{"document": "A Sicilian Mafia fugitive dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge who was set to be extradited to Italy will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence was dropped. Domenico Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra. In February he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence. But today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn. Sentence dropped: Domenico Rancadore (right and left) fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour' Although his conviction remains intact, Italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed. The case will still have to be heard by the Italian Supreme Court, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Rancadore's solicitor, Karen Todner said: 'Yesterday the Italian Court of Appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of Domenico Rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence. 'I am therefore confident that the Italian government will now withdraw their application for a European Arrest Warrant and that Mr Rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings. 'There has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and I am delighted Mr Rancadore will now be able to live in peace in England with his wife and family.' Ms Todner said she was waiting for the CPS to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge Rancadore. Once the paperwork is in order, the matter will be listed at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London and a judge will then have to approve it. The Italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court. Domenico Rancadore, pictured with hiswife Ann last year, will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence dropped . Rancadore was first arrested on a European arrest warrant at his semi-detached London home in August 2013. Although he was never convicted of murder, the Italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995. Known as the Professor, Rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his 'Mafia association'. He was convicted for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo. During protracted extradition proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, District Judge Howard Riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition. In his judgment, Judge Riddle said: 'I am satisfied that, even without the assurance, there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to Italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment.' Before his arrest in 2013, the Mafia don spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge, obscured from view. He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father, Giuseppe. Rancadore's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted. Before his arrest in 2013, Rancadore spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house in Uxbridge . There was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into Rancadore's case. Extradition expert Edward Grange tweeted: 'What a waste of time and money. After two sets of proceedings, Italy no longer seeks extradition of Rancadore.' Mr Grange, who is vice-chair of the Extradition Lawyers' Association, said: 'The purpose of the extradition request was for Rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment. 'It transpires that as of October last year the Italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence. 'So certainly from October onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the Italian authorities saying: \"Hang on, we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request\". 'Courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition, that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and European arrest warrant scheme. 'It is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying. 'Had the Italians said in October we cannot legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the European arrest warrant, I'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible.' Domenico Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra . Asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process, Mr Grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic'. Barrister Philip Marshall QC said: 'Yet more incompetence by the CPS in the Rancadore case (allegedly): his seven-year prison sentence expired in October 2014.' There was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of Rancadore's home in Manor Way, Uxbridge, London today. Curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a Mercedes car was parked on the driveway. One neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because 'you never know who will move in'. She went on: 'He seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago.' The neighbour said she last saw Rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health. A court sketch of  Domenico Rancadore. Today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn . Sharon Walker, who also lives nearby, said: 'They were a normal couple before and I'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple. 'They are very quiet. I would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere). Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy. 'He's very quiet. He always has been, even before it all blew up. They are a very quiet family.' Federico Bianchi, head of press at the Italian Embassy, said: 'When, in March 2014, the District Judge denied the extradition of Mr Rancadore to Italy, the Crown Prosecution Service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms, for which they issued a formal excuse. 'That is key to the release of Mr Rancadore because that loss of time, which obliged Italy to start the procedures afresh, issuing a new European Arrest Warrant, because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire. 'It gave the possibility to Mr Rancadore's lawyers, who are clever and know the penal code very well, to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired.' Mr Bianchi also denied that the hearing in February had been 'useless' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in Palermo on March 25. A CPS spokesman said: 'The Italian Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the decision by the Court of Appeal in Palermo is appealable to the Italian Supreme Court. 'It is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today's outcome. 'Until the European arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today, the CPS acted on behalf of the Italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary.' The CPS admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to Rancadore's lawyers on time in March last year. At the time, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders acknowledged that, as a result of the error, it was possible Rancadore would never be extradited to Italy.", "summary": "Domenico Rancadore given a seven-year sentence by Italian court in 1999 .\nHe was convicted for role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders .\nIn February the Sicilian Mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to Italy .\nToday it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired in October last year ."}

Its FireChat app paved the way for chatting to friends without the need for the web or even a mobile signal. And now developers at Open Garden have built Greenstone - a small egg-shaped gadget that acts like a beacon, or a booster, to help messages move around so-called wireless mesh networks more easily . FireChat launched last year and has been downloaded more than five million times. It takes advantage of a feature that launched in Apple’s iOS 7 called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF). Android has a similar feature that works over Bluetooth. MCF lets you send messages and photos even when a person has no signal by creating what is called a wireless mesh network. Apple added to Multipeer Connectivity framework (MCF) to iOS 7. It creates what’s called a wireless mesh network that connects phones to each other. Instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal, the features lets users send messages to people in close proximity that are in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct range - up to around 30 feet (9 metres). It does this by creating a localised network in which each phone becomes a node and the data is passed between nodes. Apple uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) - and Greenstone has been designed to solve this. When a user opens the FireChat app, they pick a screen name to start sending messages. Within the app there are 'chatrooms' with 'Everyone' and 'Nearby' options. The former will search for all users, while the latter option applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range who are also using the app. This is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground. It can also be used to save money on data plans, for example. The app creates a localised network in which each phone becomes a node, and the data is passed between nodes. Apple . uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it . easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. These messages are sent securely, so the individual nodes can’t read them. Users can also send messages anonymously to avoid snooping, for example, because data is sent from app usernames, as opposed to mobile numbers. Elsewhere, because the feature doesn’t use an internet connection, it can’t be infiltrated by hackers. The 'Everyone' Setting allows people to send information further, however. It does this by bringing all its nodes . onto one network and relaying messages from one node to another until . it reaches the final recipient. In FireChat (left) there are 'chatrooms' called Everyone and Nearby. The former searches for all users, while the latter applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range. It takes advantage of a tool used by Apple for AirDrop (right). This creates a network in which phones become nodes, and data is passed between nodes . Nodes . are simply a vehicle for passing data along a network. On a traditional . internet network any device that’s connected to the network is also . called a node. FireChat (pictured) has been downloaded more than five million times and is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground . For example, if a network has a phone, tablet, two computers and a printer connected to it there are five nodes on the network. Each . of these devices has a network address which is used to uniquely . identify each one. This helps keep track of where data is being . transferred to and from on the network. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) -  and Greenstone has been designed to plus these gaps. Christophe Daligault, chief marketing officer at Open Garden told Daily Dot: 'The combination between [Greenstone] and the smartphones will enable a community, or a neighbourhood, or a hospital, or any other situation where they want resilient communication, even in the case of not having any connectivity.' It could also be placed in certain locations at music festivals, organised protests, football matches and other events where having large numbers of people can crash networks. Greenstone is still under development and only currently works with FireChat at a range of around 20ft (6 metres). Messages sit on Greenstone until another FireChat comes within range, and the device has a one-year battery life. It can additionally hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone and the timeframe will depend on these partnerships.", "summary": "Greenstone acts like a booster for so-called wireless mesh networks .\nIt currently works with Open Garden's FireChat 'off-the-grid' FireChat app .\nBoth use an iOS feature called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF)\nInstead of sending messages using a mobile signal, the free app and gadget create a localised network where each mobile becomes a 'node'"}

{"document": "At the meeting in Paris between Pep Guardiola and Roman Abramovich in the summer of 2012, the former Barcelona coach made it clear that he craved stability. Abramovich’s track record with managers had not been good, dispensing with Claudio Ranieri, Jose Mourinho, Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Carlo Ancelotti and Andre Villas-Boas when he raged against results. Sensibly, Guardiola approached with caution. At Barcelona, his relationship with successive presidents, Joan Laporta and Sandro Rossell, had fluctuated wildly during Guardiola’s hugely successful spell as head coach. Pep Guardiola, the Bayern Munich coach, craves stability and chooses his clubs based on such assurances . Bayern's dominance of the German domestic scene means Guardiola may be tempted by a move this summer . Manuel Pellegrini's position at Manchester City is under threat as they fight for fourth place . Abramovich had been seduced by Barcelona’s football, the 14 titles that the club won during Guardiola’s four years in charge before he took off to New York with his family for a year-long sabbatical. Chelsea’s inner circle believed they had finally landed their man and Abramovich began recruiting players in anticipation of his arrival. Eden Hazard arrived from Lille for £32m and Oscar from Internacional for £25m. Marko Marin, a £7m capture from Werder Bremen, was another gamble. Then Abramovich blew the deal by firing his European Cup-winning coach the morning after a catastrophic 3-0 defeat in Turin against Antonio Conte’s Juventus. It turned out to be a painful lesson. Guardiola was spooked, pulling out of the deal to become Chelsea’s next manager the following day and decided instead to succeed Jupp Heynckes at Bayern Munich. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich believed he had landed Guardiola in the summer of 2012 - but the then-Barcelona coach was spooked by the Russian's habit of hiring and firing managers . Expecting Guardiola to arrive, Abramovich recruited the likes of Eden Hazard (right) for £32m . Guardiola opted to join Bayern Munich instead and has maintained their dominance in the Bundesliga . BARCELONA . La Liga 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 . Copa del Rey 2008-09, 2011-12 . Supercopa de Espana 2009, 2010, 2011 . UEFA Champions League 2008-09, 2010-11 . UEFA Super Cup 2009, 2011 . FIFA Club World Cup 2009, 2011 . BAYERN MUNICH . Bundesliga 2013-14 . German Cup 2013-14 . UEFA Super Cup 2013 . FIFA Club World Cup 2013 . This is precisely the scenario that is facing Manchester City as they weigh up what on earth they are going to do with a coach who can no longer motivate his players. It is an open secret that City want Guardiola to become their next manager, but the indications are that he will not be ready to leave Bayern Munich until 2016, when his three-year contract expires, at the very earliest. To wait 12 months or more for a manager who will have the top clubs in the Barclays Premier League falling at his feet when he announces that he will leave the Allianz Arena is a dangerous position to be in. Timing, as ever, is everything. According to the inside story on Guardiola’s first season at Bayern, there is an anecdote in the book Pep Confidential that indicates that he could see himself one day managing Manchester United. In the same book Guardiola also discloses that Txiki Begiristain, the former Barcelona winger who now works at City as the sporting director, also approached him in the summer of 2012. To appeal to Guardiola, he demands stability because he knows the training facilities, the stadium, the support and the financial power, through television rights, commercial arrangements and ticketing, is already in place. To fire Pellegrini with six games left of the Barclays Premier League season would be an admission by City’s owners that anything other than the Premier League trophy or the Champions League warrants a dismissal. City's place in the Premier League top four is under threat from Liverpool and Southampton . City slipped to a 4-2 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, leaving them in fourth place . Pellegrini guided City to the Premier League trophy last season but they've fallen well short this time . That was Chelsea’s game before Mourinho returned, via spells at Inter Milan and Real Madrid, and they lost a lot of goodwill over it. City felt a mild tremor too when word got out that they were about to fire Roberto Mancini, the manager who led them to their first Premier League title, on the eve of the 2013 FA Cup final against Wigan. After that, City vowed to be different. After meekly surrendering their Premier League title and being given another chasing by Barcelona over two legs in the Champions League, it is clear that City have failed to make significant progress under Pellegrini. The concern now, especially after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle on Monday evening, is that the club could yet fall out of the top four. Even though City appear to have a favourable run-in against West Ham, Aston Villa, Tottenham, QPR and Swansea before the final game of the season against Southampton, there is a contingency plan open to them. Guardiola holds the European Cup after Barcelona's 3-1 win over Manchester United in the 2011 final . Guardiola is thrown in the air by his Barcelona players after their 2009 Champions League win . Patrick Vieira, currently in charge of City's Elite Development Squad, could take charge until May . Patrick Vieira, currently in charge of City’s Elite Development Squad, has the respect of the first-team players and could yet be parachuted in to see the season through. Fourth place is critical. The difficulty beyond that scenario is what to do beyond the end of the season because a club with City’s ambitions cannot limp on for another 12 months in the hope that Guardiola becomes available. He demands consistency, a stable environment to allow him to work with his players on the training ground, preparing for a match every three days. That is the cycle for Guardiola at Bayern, picking the bones out of their 3-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at the weekend before moving on to the Champions League quarter-final against Porto in Estadio do Dragao. He is always looking ahead, much like the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov after they became friends during Guardiola’s year in New York. For Manchester City, it is down to them to make the next move.", "summary": "Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich believed he had Pep Guardiola in 2012 .\nBut the Spaniard was spooked by Abramovich's regular hiring and firing .\nGuardiola craves the stability he has found at Bayern Munich .\nAnd he will seek similar assurances should he join Manchester City .\nPellegrini's time at the Etihad appears to be drawing to a close .\nCity are clinging on to fourth spot in thePremier League .\nREAD: Patrick Vieira has all the tools to become next Man City manager ."}

During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but  a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.'

{"document": "Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola weathered his first major crisis at the German club after his team crushed Porto 7-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to move into the Champions League last four. The Spaniard in his second season in charge was with his back to the wall after their surprise 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week. Never had one of his teams lost before the semi-finals in the competition but that prospect suddenly seemed real. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach semi-finals . Thiago Alcantara jumps highest to head the home side in front on 14 minutes and set the Bayern on their way . Damned to succeed, Guardiola repeatedly said he was aware of what he needed to deliver at the five-time European champions for who a league and German Cup double was just not enough. He arrived at Bayern after their 2013 treble-winning season and expectations have not been lowered since. A semi-final exit last season only heightened pressure on Guardiola to deliver another treble this time round. But plagued by injuries in recent months and a rare internal strife after long-time team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt quit after 38 years, saying his medical team was blamed for the loss to Porto, Bayern had a far-from-perfect preparation. The doctor is hugely respected by Bayern players with many saying they would continue taking his advice and Guardiola suddenly in the firing line for allegedly falling out with a Bayern icon. Pep Guardiola said after the game that winning is a matter of life and death at Bayern . Robert Lewandowski made it three on 27 minutes as the Poland striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net . Failure to advance against Porto would have added to an already difficult week and would no doubt fan speculation about the coach's future in Munich despite having a contract to 2016. With Premier League clubs circling, a slip-up on Tuesday could prove decisive for both the club and the coach. But the Spaniard, who won 14 titles in his four seasons at Barcelona, thrived under adverse conditions with his team playing arguably their best game this season, even without injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba. Bayern frontman is congratulated by Mario Gotze (left), defender Rafinha (centre) and Thomas Muller . 'I felt it in the last few days that we would advance,' Guardiola said after Bayern fired five goals in 26 first-half minutes. 'This is about life or death and I know how very important it was,' he said. 'I know what is expected of me in this team. It is about winning just like at Barcelona.' Fans are now dreaming of a trophy on German soil in June's final in Berlin and with players gradually returning from injury, Guardiola is confident Bayern will further improve. 'We can play even better,' he said in what is no doubt a warning to other title contenders. 'After the loss in Porto the players were my heroes. Now it's easy to love them.'", "summary": "Bayern Munich beat Porto 6-1 in the Champions League quarter-final .\nThe Germans advanced 7-4 on aggregate after a 3-1 defeat in the first leg .\nPep Guardiola said he felt in the lead up to match that Bayern would win .\nThe former Barcelona boss says winning is a matter of life and death ."}

The 20-year-old from Uttoxeter's gold-winning time on Friday beat the previous record of 58.46 set by South African Cameron van der Burgh in the same venue at the 2012 Olympics. A tweet from British Swimming's account read: 'WORLD RECORD time for @adam-peaty he hits the wall in 57.92!!!!' British swimmer Adam Peaty is all smiles after setting a new world record for the 100m breast stroke . His time of 57.92 seconds has beaten the previous record of 58.46 set by Cameron van der Burgh in 2012 . Peaty has spoken of his delight that his hard work and training have paid off and is thrilled with the win . After becoming the first man in history to break through the 58-second barrier in the discipline, Peaty said: 'I can't believe it, coming in earlier I thought I could get a really good time, maybe a 58.5. 'Before that race I just thought I've done all the training for a 57, and it all paid off in the end. 'The crowd were great and they really carried me home at the end, because that was a hell of a pain train. There must be something in that lane four when it really matters.' Scotland's Ross Murdoch fought hard but was left trailing in Peaty's wake with a time of 59.12 - still inside the World Championship qualification standard - while James Wilby of Loughborough took bronze with a 1:00.31. Ben Proud topped the podium in the men's 50m freestyle by coming home in 21.99, with his fellow Plymouth swimmer Thomas Fannon taking silver in 22.48 from Andrew Weatheritt (22.50). In the women's competition, Fran Halsall stormed to victory in the open 50m freestyle. The 25-year-old claimed her 10th consecutive title with a time of 24.37 and said afterwards: 'It's pretty good to be able to come in 10 years in a row and be the best in Britain. 'I didn't have the ideal preparation coming into this meet, I got sent home from the World Championships in December and it took a lot longer than expected to get back into full training. 'Last year I went a 24.5 at this meet then on to a 23.9 in the summer, so to come here and already be two tenths up on that is a great sign.' Lauren Quigley of Stockport Metro hit 25.22 for silver ahead of Rebecca Guy, who clocked in at 25.49. In the morning Rachael Kelly had defended her British Championship title with a time of 57.72 in the open 100m butterfly final.

{"document": "George Osborne has refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. The Chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be ‘depriving more families’ of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne, pictured visiting the Red Cone Cafe in Stourbridge, refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government’s austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could ‘rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you’ve already done in this Parliament?’ The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family’s annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: ‘You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. ‘We’ve got a track record, we’ve got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.’ Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: ‘I’ve given you a very clear answer. We’ve created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. ‘We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can’t do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.’ Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could ‘rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you’ve already done in this Parliament?' The Chancellor said the Coalition had saved £21billion in this Parliament, and the ‘same principles’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare . The Chancellor said the Coalition had saved £21billion in this Parliament, and the ‘same principles’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare. ‘This is perfectly achievable and anyone who thinks that the job of reforming welfare has somehow been completed, I think, is mistaken. ‘We want to go on creating a welfare system which rewards work and the aspirations of families and protect the most vulnerable’, he said. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year. Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith is sympathetic to the idea. He recently said it was ‘well worth looking at’ and could save ‘significant money’ and help with ‘behaviour change’ by forcing couples to think carefully about whether they could afford to have another child. It was not seriously considered in this Parliament due to opposition from the Liberal Democrats and David Cameron appeared to reject it last year amid concerns it would alienate low-income families. The event attended by Mr Osborne, and Treasury minister David Gauke and Priti Patel was an analysis of the Labour’s party fiscal plans, if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. He claimed the Labour party would ‘never’ eliminate the budget deficit – unlike Tory plans to run a surplus by 2020 – because they would borrow billions of pounds every year and not cut spending. ‘When the economy's growing, and we're not in recession, we should be raising more than we spend’, he said. ‘That's the way, proven around the world, to bear down on your national debt and best prepare yourself for any future economic storms. Fixing the roof while the sun is shining. ‘The Labour Party don't want to do that, they only talked about balancing the current, day to day, spending while continuing to borrow to pay for capital spending. What they don't tell you is that means a permanent, never-ending budget deficit.’ Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said Mr Osborne had put middle income families in the firing line. He said: ‘The Tories won't admit where their £12 billion of welfare cuts will come from, but after this press conference it's now clear middle income families are in the firing line. ‘George Osborne repeatedly refused to rule out rolling child benefit into universal credit. This would mean 4.3 million families losing over £1,000 a year, according to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies.’ An aide to Mr Osborne played down suggestions the Conservatives were planning changes to child benefit. �4a, .", "summary": "Chancellor paves the way for further cuts to payments with £1,000-a-year .\nChallenged to ‘rule out depriving more people of child benefit' at briefing .\nRefuses to rule out rolling Child Benefit into Universal Credit system .\nLabour says Osborne has put middle income families 'in the firing line'"}

But talented Marcel Hirscher added a little extra flare to his downhill slalom run by bringing the pistes alive with a colourful display. The skier teamed up with The Red Bull Media House and Starelation to create the unusual stunt, using coloured powder packed into the poles he swerved around. Rainbow run! Marcel Hirscher performs during the project 'Marcel Hirscher Colours' at Reiteralm near Schladming . Blue eruption! The coloured powder was flung across the slopes as the talented skier went passed . 'It was a surreal experience – simply amazing!' said the four times World Champion skier, Marcel Hirscher . 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website' The process involved 11 cameras, a specially-enhanced slope, and three days to set up before creating the incredible video in one take with the 26-year-old Austrian. Marcel Hirscher slalomed in and out of poles filled to the brim with coloured, biodegradable powder, which erupted upon contact. Six GoPros, and a range of other cameras, including a hand held one by the skier captured the dazzling rainbow effect, which surrounded him at every turn. As the run required more ice than snow, a section of the Reiteralm slopes in Austria had to be watered, so that it could freeze over night in preparation. The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run in one take from a number of angles, before the ice melted. The most difficult part of the incredible video as filming it from all angles, without getting another cameraman in the shot. 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website, 'and create unforgettable images. And I think we succeeded!' 'It was a surreal experience – simply amazing! I couldn't ski with the speed I normally do in races, even though the course was very steep in the first part, up to 75 percent incline,' he explains. 'At each gate I was blinded for a split second because I had to ski through a cloud of yellow and blue.' The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run from a number of angles, before the ice melted during the day . The biodegradable powder was placed in slalom poles along the course, and multiple cameras were set up to capture the effect from different angles .

The team picked vibrant colours which would contrast heavily with the crisp white snow . The team wanted to get as close as they could to the skier but without any cameramen appearing in any shots . One chance! The team knew they had one attempt to get the shot, as once the powder had been released it would ruin any other shots . Born in Annaberg-Lungötz, Salzburg, Hirscher made his World Cup debut in March 2007 . Marcel's father Ferdinand Hirscher said on his website: 'Marcel and I have been travelling to various races since his childhood. I contribute with my experience from this. I make sure that we – together with the coaches and the service crew – get to the maximum as a team.'

{"document": "Two of England’s most ambitious and well-resourced academies go head-to-head on Monday night as Manchester City play Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final. Both teams are packed with talented players eager to make an impression in front of the TV cameras and stake their claim for first-team involvement in the seasons to come. Ahead of the match at City’s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . WHAT’S THE OCCASION? It’s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it’ll take place at City’s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their £200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox’s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry . Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . It wasn’t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards’ team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James’ Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month . Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head. A Colkett penalty then put daylight between the teams as Chelsea won a thrilling tie 5-4 on aggregate. YOUTH CUP PEDIGREE . Manchester City have twice lifted the FA Youth Cup - in 1986 and 2008. The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League. Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons. Their wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: ‘Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea. It’s up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I’m convinced once they see us it’s very difficult to walk away from.’ Chelsea coach Joe Edwards: ‘Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week [when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League] is a massive plus for us. Once you get a taste of winning, you want that feeling again and again.’ PLAYERS TO WATCH . MANCHESTER CITY .

The four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property cost Dinnigan $4.45 million back in 2009, and is set to go under the hammer on May 23. After purchasing a lavish $6.5 million Watsons Bay property just last month with husband Bradley Cocks, Dinnigan is hoping for a cool $6 million when the lavishly renovated Paddington house sells. Scroll down for video . Fashion queen Collette Dinnigan has put her four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property on the market . The two-storey terrace home was built in 1880, and is set on 379 square metres of prime Paddington real estate. 'It's one of the oldest houses in Paddington, and the renovations are just stunning,' said selling agent Ben Collier for MsGrath Estate Agents, who is selling the property along with Will Manning at Ballard property. The international designer and her husband carefully renovated the property to be 'very sympathetic and in keeping with the period style, while still keeping it contemporary', said Mr Collier. Mr Collier said that the owners loved the combination of the house's proximity to restaurants and cafes, along with the unusually large terrace which makes the property an actual house. 'Most terraces in the area are around six metres, but the property's terrace is about twice that,' he said. Set back from the street in the exclusive suburb, the couple share their meticulously crafted home with children 10-year-old Estella and three-year-old Hunter.

{"document": "A taxi driver has been ordered to pay compensation to a passenger who was left with severe brain injuries after he jumped out of the moving car. Kristopher Hicks, now 27, was on his way home from a night out in Bath, Somerset, with his girlfriend in a taxi driven by Michael Young, 56, five years ago. Mr Young, a former soldier, had mistakenly believed Mr Hicks was planning to 'do a runner' and decided to drive him back to the rank in a bid to teach him a lesson. But when Mr Hicks objected, the driver continued on for almost a mile, leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph. He suffered devastating brain injuries, developed epilepsy and now requires round-the-clock care from his mother. Mr Hicks' family, from Bath, took driver Mr Young to the High Court (pictured), where a judge ruled he had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger . Mr Hicks' family, from Bath, took Mr Young to the High Court. There, Mr Justice Edis ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned Mr Hicks, who was therefore entitled to damages. The exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'. Speaking on behalf of the family, lawyer James Davies said: 'This was a terrible incident in which Kristopher suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life. 'The latest judgement agrees that Kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress.' Mr Hicks, who was 23 at the time of the incident, had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend Abigail Noad at Orange Grove taxi rank in Bath to his home in the Foxhill area, according to high court documents. In a police interview, Mr Young said he had become suspicious after hearing Ms Noad joke that the couple were not going to 'do a runner'. Deciding the issue of liability, the judge said Mr Young mistakenly decided Mr Hicks was not going to pay the fare on November 2 in 2010, adding there was no basis for him to think so. The driver had decided to take Mr Hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible. Mr Hicks, who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night, decided he should try to escape. Mr Justice Edis said: 'The end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed. I do not know why he did this. 'It may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so, but the true motive will never be known.' He said had Mr Hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage. Mr Hicks had gotten into the taxi at the Orange Grove rank in Bath (pictured) in 2010 with his girlfriend . 'I have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released,' he added. 'This is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates.' The judge said it was a 'stark and unattractive choice' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to Mr Hicks. He was also entitled to a further £250 for unlawful imprisonment. Lawyers representing Mr Hicks said the incident left him with 'devastating' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother Gill. Speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the High Court, James Davies, said: 'Whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation, he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy, headaches, fatigue, suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell. 'He is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work.' Both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which Mr Young will have to pay.", "summary": "Driver Michael Young, 56, thought passenger was planning to 'do a runner'\nSo he decided to take passenger Kristopher Hicks him back to the taxi rank .\nMr Hicks jumped out, sustaining head injuries, and now needs 24-hour care .\nJudge rules  Mr Hicks was unlawfully imprisoned and will now get damages ."}
{"document": "A super-fertile dental nurse is being hailed a hero after helping scores of childless couples try to conceive - by donating 50 eggs. Mother-of-two Kelly Parsons, from Morden, south west London, has already enabled two couples to have twins and another woman give birth to a boy, thanks to her willingness to go through the painful donation procedure. In the space of 11 months, the 35-year-old's eggs have become twin girls, twin boys and a baby boy. Kelly Parsons, 35, from London (pictured with daughters Emily, four, (left) and 11-year-old Charlotte (right) has donate 50 of her eggs to help childless couples conceive . Kelly said: 'Despite the pain, it was worth it to bring joy to families that would never be able to have kids naturally. 'To have the urge to have kids and not be able to have them must be heartbreaking. I'm only a little part of making these babies. 'I am sure the parents will probably curse me in the middle of the night when they have to do bottle feeds.' Kelly and her train dispatcher husband Dean, 41, had a daughter, Charlotte, now 11, in 2003. After eight years of trying and three heartbreaking miscarriages, Kelly gave birth to daughter Emily in January 2011. Kelly then decided to start donating her eggs to other childless couples, in a bid to help as many families share the joys of children. Kelly and her husband Dean, 41, (second right) struggled for eight years to conceive Emily, with Kelly suffering three heartbreaking miscarriages . She said: 'I wanted the eggs to go to a husband and wife so that the kids would be raised in a similar environment to our family - after all, these eggs could have been my children. 'Dean wasn't totally on board but because I have supported him through so many crazy things, he knew it was my turn. 'You can only donate your eggs until you are 35, and because I was 33 at the time I felt like the clock was ticking.' Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries, and after a few months she will have stored up enough for them to be harvested. She said: 'After the first time I donated eggs I was knackered but so happy I'd done it. Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries . In all, the nurse has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies - twin boys, twin girls, and a baby boy . 'A week later I got a call to say five of them had been fertilised and two had been implanted into the mum-to-be. 'They'd also frozen the others so they could have more kids in the future. 'From then on I was on tenterhooks, hoping her body would accept the embryos. 'Although I knew nothing about the couple, I really felt a connection to them.' In all, Kelly has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies. Also, a number of her eggs have been frozen for future use. Controversially, Kelly has told her 11-year-old daughter that she has brothers and sisters. Controversially she has told her daughter Charlotte that she has brothers and sisters out there - and she has elected for her egg donor kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 . She also chose for the kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 - as she wants her girls to know their half siblings. She added: 'I would love to see if they look like me and am curious to meet them when they grow up. 'Charlotte is so excited by the thought she might get to meet her brothers and sisters one day. 'She even wants to donate her eggs because she thinks what I've done is amazing. 'The people that I've helped have babies have been through the menopause or cancer meaning they could never conceive naturally. Imagine having that urge to become a mother but not being able to have a baby, it must be devastating.

{"document": "Arsene Wenger insists he isn’t haunted by his decision to back out of signing Eden Hazard in 2012 – even if he does accept the Chelsea attacker is getting better every year. It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger’s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard’s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager’s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season’s standout player for £32million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out . Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house . Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille . That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: ‘I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. ‘It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.’ Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday’s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. He said: ‘It’s very close. Let’s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn’t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. ‘I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. ‘He can turn games when it’s 0-0 and when it’s tight. That’s always a sign of top quality.’ Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote .

{"document": "A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said \"we all make mistakes and we are only human\". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'", "summary": "Geoff Haigh, 61, wanted to marry partner Heather after cancer diagnosis .\nCouple married at Manchester register office but day was full of blunders .\nGuests forced to listen to wedding song 10 times in a row and venue dirty .\nMarriage certificate had spelling errors and wrong date and names ."}
{"document": "Prince Andrew will not face court action in the US over claims he had sex with an under-age girl, after a Florida judge ruled her claims must be struck out. Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew’s friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile and sex offender. But last night Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a ‘sex slave’ to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be ‘struck from the record’. Scroll down for video . Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. Her claims she was forced to sleep with him have now been struck from the court record . Prince Andrew pictured leaving an Easter service at Windsor Castle on Sunday. The judge ruled the details of the accusations against him had no bearing on the reopening of the lawsuit against Epstein . The judge refused to make a statement regarding the veracity of Miss Roberts’s allegations, but issued an order that the ‘lurid’ and ‘unnecessary’ claims should not be involved in the Epstein case. ‘At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,’ he wrote. ‘These unnecessary details shall be stricken.’ Prince Andrew is not mentioned by name in the ten-page ruling, made in the Palm Beach County court, Florida. But Judge Marra refers to the powerful people Miss Roberts was allegedly forced to have sex with by Epstein. Her claims of taking part in an orgy with the Duke and sleeping with him on two other occasions when she was 17 – below the age of consent in Florida – were described as ‘immaterial and impertinent’. In 17 words, the judge may have drawn a line under a controversy that has dogged Prince Andrew since January. Miss Roberts, referred to as ‘Jane Doe 3’ in court papers, and another woman were hoping to join two other alleged victims of Epstein in suing the U.S. government over a plea deal prosecutors struck with the financier. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' But Judge Marra ruled yesterday that the Jane Doe 3 and 4 applications should be denied and it was therefore ‘unnecessary’ for them to be added as plaintiffs. When the court claim surfaced earlier this year, Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace refused to go into any details regarding the accusations. However, in late January he briefly referred to the allegations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he wanted to ‘reiterate and reaffirm’ palace statements that insisted he never had any sexual contact or relationship with Miss Roberts. She has repeatedly claimed she had sex three times with Andrew when she was 17 – a claim he emphatically denies – and served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington DC. But they were returned to sender. Her legal team’s bid to serve papers on the Duke came after courier FedEx returned a similar letter as it was ‘refused’ by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She claimed that under the orders of paedophile Epstein she was ‘forced’ to have sex with the prince three times in 2001 – in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. The 55-year-old royal was so concerned about the allegations that he consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Andrew’s long friendship with Epstein was said to include lavish parties and exotic holidays, but it raised questions over the prince’s choice of friends. He was introduced to the billionaire by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell. The fifth in line to the throne was forced to effectively cool, but not end, the friendship when sex claims were made against the financier. In June 2008, Epstein began serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to soliciting a girl, 14, for prostitution. Andrew was summoned by the Queen after pictures emerged of him in New York with Epstein in February 2011, after the financier had been released from prison. It emerged Epstein had given Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson £15,000 to help reduce her debts. Last night Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Duke was not a party to the court action and was not given the opportunity to rebut the allegations through the court.

{"document": "(CNN)Jon Reiter is no stranger to Mount Everest -- its world-record height, its prestige, its challenges. And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. \"It's been a really rough day,\" Susan Reiter told CNN. \"Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive.\" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. \"Huge disaster,\" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. \"Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.\" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that \"a huge avalanche swept over basecamp\" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. \"On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,\" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. \"This also makes it more difficult to search for people.\" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. \"The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,\" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. \"Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal.\" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an \"adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer.\" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. \"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,\" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,\" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, \"whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation.\" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. \"On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,\" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, \"which is very dangerous anyway,\" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, \"the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves.\" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. \"It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,\" he said. \"I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. \"It's been a bad few years on Everest,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength.\" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, \"Into Thin Air.\" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. \"This is our job,\" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost \"friends in brothers\" in the 2014 avalanche. \"So there is always a risk of death.\" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of \"The Seven Summits\" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 \"because it didn't feel right\" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? \"You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,\" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. \"But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back.\" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors .

{"document": "Inter Milan target Yaya Toure has admitted that he is open to 'new challenges' and will not remain at Manchester City just to pick up his £220,000-a-week wages. The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham . Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.' City find themselves fourth in the Premier League table after a dismal run of form and out of the Champions League after a two-legged defeat by Barcelona at the last 16 stage. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City . Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer .

{"document": "(CNN)The overturned convertible was smoldering, when police pulled up to it on a New Jersey roadway. The driver was pinned inside -- and unconscious. Not knowing when the car might burst into full flame, they scrambled to save her, while a police dash cam rolled. CNN obtained the footage from affiliate WPIX. Kinnelon Police Officers Mark Ehrenburg and Ricky Ferriola cut the seat belt from her, then dragged the woman's limp body away from the crash to start emergency medical care. Not a minute later, flames licked out of the car. Two more minutes -- an explosion. All three were lucky to escape the flames. The rescue started when someone reported an erratic driver on Thursday, and the officers sped off to investigate. When they pulled up at the scene, the 2006 Toyota Solara convertible was already a smoking wreck. Its horn was blaring. The officers ran over to the flipped over car, and shouted over the honking horn at the driver, \"Can you hear me?\" No response, not even a gesture, the video showed. It took them two minutes to cut off the seat belt, as smoke kept rising. Once they had her in safety, the officers hooked the driver up to a defibrillator and started CPR. The woman, identified by the Kinnelon Police Department as Dawn Milosky, 45, of Beachwood, New Jersey, was airlifted to Morristown Medical Center and survived. She's been charged with driving while intoxicated, having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle, reckless driving and with failure to stay in her lane, according to WPIX. Kinnelon Police Sgt. Chris Carbone told WPIX that they released the video to show that the driver may have died, if others had not informed the police.

{"document": "Still employed: Rolling Stone is not expected to take any action against Sabrina Rubin Erdely, whose reporting was roundly discredited . An independent review of Rolling Stone's story about an alleged violent gang rape at the University of Virginia said the story fell apart because of 'basic, even routine' failures of journalism. Professors at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism issued a 12,000-word autopsy of the discredited story Sunday night, going through its shortcomings step by step. Rolling Stone bosses commissioned the review after the story, by contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely, was called into serious question. However, despite the uncompromising conclusions of the journalism experts, nobody will lose their job over the story. Jann Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone, confirmed to the New York Times that everybody would remain in their positions. He defended her reporting, and described the supposed rape victim as 'a really expert fabulist storyteller'. Erdely, who went to ground as the row over her article erupted, issued an apology in the wake of the review, admitting 'I did not go far enough'. Her piece credulously recounted the story of an anonymous student - referred to as Jackie - who said she was lured to the Phi Kappa Psi house and raped by a gang of seven men. It described the ordeal, during which Jackie said she was passed from man to man in an excruciating three hours of pain, during which she was also supposedly penetrated with a beer bottle upstairs during a pledging event. The article recounted the event in vivid, graphic detail based on Jackie's account. It said: 'There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. 'When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh.' Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Describing the moment she supposedly passed out from pain, it continued: 'Someone handed her classmate a beer bottle. Jackie stared at the young man, silently begging him not to go through with it. 'And as he shoved the bottle into her, Jackie fell into a stupor, mentally untethering from the brutal tableau, her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor.' The review spelled out extensive contact between Erdely and Jackie, spanning eight interviews. Erdely wrote 405 pages of notes about the story. Jackie also spent four hours speaking to a Rolling Stone fact-checker. Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Erdely had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker, but Jackie said she was not 'comfortable' with the idea of him being contacted for the story. But they ultimately decided to rely on her for virtually all the information in the account, which led to inconsistencies not being discovered until after publication. Erdely asked Jackie again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began. This time she agreed - but it emerged she did not even know how to spell the surname of the man, referred to as 'Drew' in the story. Experts at Columbia concluded that Erdely, her editors, and the fact-checking department all failed to try hard enough to speak to the accused, and other people mentioned in the story. And, they said, when they did speak to organizations, including the fraternity and UVA, they provided so little information that there was no way for them to check the events themselves and flag any inconsistent information. They said that had they reached out to some people named - specifically friends whom Jackie spoke to immediately after the supposed rape - her credibility would have collapsed in time to ditch the story. Erdely asked to speak to one of the friends - fellow student Ryan Duffin - using Jackie as a go-between. Jackie told Erdely he refused and was 'incredulous' at the request, calling the Rolling Stone article a 's*** show'. Duffin later said that Jackie never spoke to him at all. Erdely admitted that if she had spoken to Duffin and realized the inconsistency, she would likely have dropped Jackie's story. Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named  Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Another possible way Erdely could have found out inconsistencies in the story would have been giving fuller details to the fraternity and UVA when asking them for comment, the review said. Stepehn Scipione, the chapter president of Phi Kappa, was asked to comment on the allegations without being given dates of the supposed attack or any details about who was involved. He told the review: 'It was complete bull***t. They weren't telling me what they were going to write about. They weren't telling me any dates or details.' When the full story was published, Phi Kappa Psi responded by pointing out there had been no party on the date Jackie gave. They also said that - despite claims of a pledging ritual taking place at the time - the fraternity house was then home to no pledges. The review concluded: 'Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in A Rape on Campus is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. 'The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. 'The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. 'The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.' It recommended that Rolling Stone tighten its procedures around fact-checking and offer more details when requesting comment from subjects. It also questioned the use of pseudonyms, and said the magazine should consider banning them. At the same time as publishing the review, Rolling Stone announced that it was 'officially retracting' the story, which has amassed more than 2.7million views online. The page where the story was hosted until Sunday night now redirected to the Columbia review, which has the subtitle 'An anatomy of a journalistic failure'. Sean Woods, one of Jackie's editors, described the scandal over the article as 'It's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience'. He later added: 'Ultimately, we were too deferential to our rape victim; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting. 'We should have been much tougher, and in not doing that, we maybe did her a disservice.' In a personal statement released online, Erdely said: 'Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgements in my reporting was a brutal and humbling expereince. 'I want to offer my deepest apologies: to Rolling Stone's readers, to my Rolling Stone editors and colleagues, to the UVA community, and to any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a resolut of my article. She said that as a reporter she must: 'weigh my compassion against my journalistic duty to find the truth. 'However, in the case of Jackie and her account of her traumatic rape, I did not go far enough to verify her story. 'I allowed my concern for Jackie's well-being, my fear of re-traumatizing her, and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts.

{"document": "(CNN)Twenty years ago, on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  The attack killed 168 men, women and children, injured hundreds more, and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. The attack's aftermath saw a storm of media coverage with themes such as \"attack on the heartland\" and America's \"lost innocence.\" In fact, the bombing took the country by surprise. It wasn't simply the scale of the tragedy that drew attention, but the fact that the bombing exposed something new: American citizens targeting their own government with a deadliness hitherto unseen. The public became aware of the true danger of the extreme right.  Reports connected McVeigh and his accomplice Terry Nichols to anti-government ideology movements, such as the militia movement, as well as to white supremacist causes. Law enforcement also played catchup. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1994 annual report on terrorism had given short shrift to the extreme right.  Its coverage of domestic terrorism focused on the activities of Puerto Rican radicals and animal rights and environmental extremists. In contrast, the report spent only a paragraph describing the threat from right-wing extremists.  It ignored the rapidly growing militia and sovereign citizen movements, and made no reference to events in Idaho and Texas. In late 1992, at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, a standoff between U.S. Marshals and Randy Weaver's family resulted in the death of a marshal, a young boy and the boy's unarmed mother. And in 1993, federal agents launched an ill-conceived raid on property near Waco, Texas, belonging to the Branch Davidians sect, leading to a bloody shootout and a 51-day standoff, which ended in the death of almost all the Davidians, including a number of children. These incidents infuriated the entire extreme right, which saw them as deliberate attempts by the government to kill American citizens. After Oklahoma City, everything changed. The FBI shifted its priorities, hiring new agents and reassigning staff to work on domestic terrorism cases.  It significantly expanded the number of Joint Terrorism Task Forces and went to Congress with a lengthy \"want\" list. The effort actually paid off.  Increased scrutiny of right-wing extremists resulted in a flurry of arrests for everything from terrorist plots to hate crimes.  Though it had paid a high price to do so, it seemed that the United States had recognized the dangers that right-wing extremists posed. However, just six years after the Oklahoma City bombing, an event occurred that pushed to the background those lessons so dearly won. The September 11, 2001, terror attacks -- attacks of a scale and ferocity that dwarfed even that of the Oklahoma City bombing -- commanded the full attention of the nation.  The government, law enforcement, the news media and the public all rushed to grapple with the issue of Islamic extremism. Unfortunately, rather than expanding national attention to encompass the dangers of both radical Islam and right-wing extremism, the 9/11 attacks simply shifted attention away from the extreme right. Certainly, the 9/11 attacks warranted great attention. They made starkly clear the threat that international radical Islamist groups posed to the United States. Moreover, the surge of right-wing extremism that marked the 1990s had seemingly ebbed. Thus it is no real surprise that concern over right-wing violence faded into the background. The significance of the Oklahoma City bombing, in terms of its service as a warning about right-wing violence, became greatly lessened. This is a lesson that Americans must now recall and recover. Radical Islam, whether abroad or homegrown, represents a serious threat to the safety and security of Americans.  But right-wing extremism did not disappear after September 11. Its history since the Oklahoma City bombing has consisted of a steady stream of plots, conspiracies, terrorist acts, and hate crimes.  It, too, represents a serious threat. In fact, in recent years, violence from the extreme right has again surged—and at levels reminiscent of the dark days of the 1990s. From 1995 through 2000, according to statistics from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, right-wing extremists were responsible for at least 47 different terrorist acts, conspiracies or plots. However, during the past six years, from 2009 through 2014, right-wing extremists in the U.S. were involved in at least 42 actual or attempted terrorist acts. In other words, right-wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the Oklahoma City bombing. These statistics illustrate that \"homegrown violent extremism\" is not limited to extremism motivated by radical Islam.  The anger and hate that generated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 is still around in 2015—and still dangerous. The 20th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing provides a new opportunity for us to ensure that its significance does not disappear from the public eye. What the tragedies of 1995 and 2001 together teach is that the United States faces threats from multiple sources of extremism, all of which must be taken seriously. Consequently, Americans must have the wisdom to respond effectively and intelligently to ideological violence stemming from all sources. That would be the most positive way to pay homage to the victims of April 19, 1995.", "summary": "Twenty years ago, on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh set off a massive bomb in Oklahoma City .\nDeborah Lauter and Mark Pitcavage: Right-wing extremism should still be taken seriously ."}

Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says.

McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said.

The Dublin-based airline has informed passengers travelling on the notorious flight from Glasgow Prestwick Airport to the Spanish island that their alcohol purchases from duty free shops are no longer allowed in the cabin, and they risk being kicked off the flight if they don’t comply. Ryanair refused to explain the reason behind its decision, but it follows a handful of incidents involving boorish behaviour by inebriated travellers heading to the island for days of sun, booze and revelry. Passengers' hand luggage will be searched before they board at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said the airline . An email sent to Ibiza-bound passengers and obtained by the Daily Record said: ‘Customers will not be allowed to carry alcohol on board and all cabin baggage will be searched at boarding gates. ‘Any alcohol purchased in airport shops or elsewhere must be packed in a suitable item of baggage, which will be tagged and placed in the aircraft hold free of charge. ‘Customers attempting to conceal alcohol will be denied travel without refund or compensation.’ In a statement to MailOnline Travel, a Ryanair spokesman said the airline made the decision after consultations with customers and airport officials. Passengers who are caught trying to sneak alcohol into the cabin risk being kicked off the flight . The spokesman said: ‘Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind. ‘The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time.’ The spokesman declined to identify the incidents which sparked the ban or say what will happen to passengers caught trying to sneak alcohol on board.

The move is the latest by Twitter to boost engagement for its users amid growth which is slower than expected . An algorithm will also automatically remove abuse before you even see it. Twitter already asks users who violate its abuse guidelines to delete content, and can suspend accounts permanently if they don't. But under the new changes, Twitter has added a middle-ground. Its new enforcement option lets the support team temporarily lock abusive accounts for a set period of time, up to 12 hours. In its last quarterly update, Twitter said the number of active monthly users of the San Francisco-based one-to-many messaging service monthly grew to 288 million. This is just four million more than in the previous quarter. Twitter reports its results for the first quarter next week. Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo recently said his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In a memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. For months Twitter has been rolling out features designed to rid the site of the scourge of trolls . The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, auto-populated fields, and it now requires less initial information. It has also improved the ways in which abuse can be reported to law enforcement. Last month, the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter said an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent.

{"document": "Accused: Dr Ram Manohar, 38, of Barnston, Wirral, has denied four counts of sexual assault . A senior doctor facing sexual assault allegations from two separate nurses is accused of groping the breast of one of them and saying 'you bad girl' after smacking her on the bottom. A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays . Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.' Manohar, of Barnston, Wirral, denies four counts of sexual assault. The trial continues.

{"document": "Two hitmen associates of a ‘Freddy Krueger’ killer who tried to gun down a rival during London’s bloodiest gang feud have been jailed for a total of 44 years today. Christopher Annan, 24, and Tyrone Wright, 20, took part in a gun attack on Tottenham Turks gang member Inan Eren. The 35-year-old victim, who survived, was ambushed as he arrived home on the evening of 30 December 2012, shot three times in the arm, stomach and buttock. The attack was led by hitman Jamie Marsh-Smith, 23, a fearsome hired gun who had earned the nickname ‘Freddy’ after the Nightmare on Elm Street killer. Jamie Marsh-Smith (left) known as 'Freddy' after the Nightmare on Elm Street character, executed gang boss Zafer Eren (right). He also took part in the attack on Eren's cousin Inan for which two men were jailed today . The deranged Freddy Krueger. Marsh-Smith got his nickname carrying out contract hits, including the failed one on Inan Eren on December 30, 2012 . He was locked up for at least 38 years in July last year for the attack on Mr Eren, the murder of crime boss Zafer Eren, and a botched attempt to kill his own getaway driver Samuel Zerei, 22. A jury at the Old Bailey this afternoon convicted Annan and Wright of attempted murder after a retrial. They both held their heads in their hands when the verdicts were announced, while cries of ‘they are innocent’ rung out from the public gallery. Judge John Bevan QC sentenced both men at 2.15pm. He blamed Wright’s parents as the two hitmen were jailed for the gun attack which has left victim Inan Eren permanently on crutches. Annan, the older of the pair, was jailed for 24 years with a five year period of extended licence. Wright, who was just 18 at the time of the shooting, was jailed for 20 years. ‘It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to have to sentence young men such as yourselves for serious gun crime of this kind’, said Judge Bevan. He said the ‘medieval turf war’ between the two Turkish families had now reached ‘epidemic proportions.’ ‘It’s high time the two families and their connections realise the manipulative and lawless behaviour will have consequences beyond the normal level of punishment,’ the judge added. ‘This was professional offending by a gang acting for profit as hitmen, of which Jamie Marsh-Smith was in charge and the leader.’ The judge said there had been 26 incidents in the drug war between the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks since 2009, including 19 where guns were used. Annan was jailed for three-and-a-half years in 2006, when he was just 16, for stabbing a boy who had punched him. He was jailed for three years in 2008 for dealing crack cocaine and heroin, and was also convicted of possession of heroin in 2012. He was jailed for 38 years for the shooting of Inan Eren, the murder of his cousin and crime boss Zafer Eren and a botched attempt to kill his own getaway driver . Inan Eren had given evidence in court on crutches, and still has one of the bullets lodged in his body. He was gunned down by his front door as he desperately tried to get inside to escape the gunmen. ‘I accept he thought he was going to die, and he was shot in the presence of his wife and child’, said the judge. The judge added he could not be sure who the gunman was during the attack, but accepted Wright had played a lesser role as a junior member of the crew. Getaway driver Samuel Zerei was shot by Marsh-Smith because he feared he would ‘blabber . Annan, of Denham Road, Whetstone, was told he will serve at least two thirds of his 24 year sentence before being released. Wright, of Lea Bridge Road, Leyton, was told by Judge Bevan: ‘I feel sorry for you for the lack of parental discipline and guidance, which so many young men like you suffer.’ Relatives of the two men stood weeping outside the Old Bailey for over an hour after the pair were jailed. When jailing Marsh-Smith in July last year, Judge Bevan condemned both sides of the Turkish gang war that has claimed five lives since 2009. ‘The use of the streets of this city for the Turks to fight a medieval turf war over drug distribution, in this case using Afro-Caribbean males as hitmen, is as intolerable as it is unacceptable’, he said. Today’s verdicts are the latest chapter in a ‘bloody and lethal’ feud between the ‘Tottenham Turks’ and the ‘Hackney Turks’ criminal gangs in north London that has raged since 2009. In March 2009 innocent shopkeeper Ahmet Paytak, 50, was shot dead at Euro Food and Wines in Hornsey Road, Holloway, by Ricardo Dwyer, a hitman hired by the Hackney Turks. Dwyer, then 27, was jailed for 32 years in December 2013 for the attack, which seriously wounded Mr Paytak's son Huseyin, then 21. On October 2, 2009, Tottenham Turk member Oktay Erbasli was shot and killed while driving in Tottenham. Three days later the Tottenham Turks took revenge with the shooting of 21-year-old Cem Duzgun at a social club frequented by Hackney Turk members in Upper Clapton Road. The feud continued with the murder of Ali Armagan, 32, near Turnpike Lane tube station on February 1, 2012. Bungling hitman Ricardo Dwyer (left) shot dead innocent shopkeeper Ahmet Paytak, 50, in March 2009 at Euro Food and Wines in Hornsey Road, Holloway . Then on the evening of December 30, 2012, Marsh-Smith, Annan and Wright shot Inan Eren as he arrived home. When Mr Eren survived the attack, the target shifted to his cousin Zafer Eren, another leading member of the Tottenham Turks. At 7.20pm on April 18, 2013, Zafer was shot as he walked through the security gates to his home at Fontaine Court off Southgate High Street in north London. Marsh-Smith donned a V for Vendetta mask before firing seven shots from the pavement, three of which struck Mr Eren in the back. He then escaped in the back of a burgundy Peugeot 308 driven by Zerei. Four days after that attack, Marsh-Smith shot Zerei in Markfield Park, Tottenham because he feared he would ‘blabber’. Marsh-Smith, of Ennerdale House, Green Lanes, Manor House, north London, was convicted of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 38 years. Zerei, of Hathersage Court, Newington Green, north London, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Marsh-Smith’s half brother, Wayne McNeish, 32, of West End Lane, West Hampstead, was jailed for four-and-a-half years in July for perverting the course of justice by helping Marsh-Smith to flee the country after the shootings.", "summary": "Christopher Annan, 24, and Tyrone Wright, 20, jailed for attempted murder .\nTook part in gun attack on Tottenham Turks gang member Inan Eren, 35 .\nHe was shot three times in the arm, stomach and buttock but still survived .\nBrutal attack was led by hitman Jamie Marsh-Smith, 23, nicknamed 'Freddy'\nHe was jailed for 38 years for the shooting, the murder of Eren's cousin and crime boss Zafer Eren and a botched attempt to kill his own getaway driver ."}

Philippe Coutinho eventually broke the deadlock after 161 goalless minutes across the two games but Blackburn came close to levelling matters when goalkeeper Simon Eastwood was denied in stoppage time. Sportsmail's Oliver Todd rated the player's performances at Ewood Park. BLACKBURN ROVERS: (4-4-2) Eastwood 7 .

Simon even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time after performing well in goal . Henley 7 . Solid at right back, he kept Raheem Sterling quieter than most full backs in the Barclays Premier League would. Restricted in going forward as he kept an eye on England star. Baptiste 8 . So often found in the way of Liverpool's shots, even though he was suffering with a hamstring injury. Performed heroics at the back but couldn't quite hold out before being substituted. Kilgallon 8 . Another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge he faced from Daniel Sturridge and mainly restricted the England striker to potshots from range. Matt Kilgallon was another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge of Daniel Sturridge . Olsson 7 . Could have gone down when under pressure inside the Liverpool area but his honesty was his own enemy. Solid at the back. Conway 6.5 .

Corry Evans is no stranger to a challenge, and he put himself about in midfield, replacing Jay Spearing . Evans 6.5 . No stranger to a challenge, put himself about in midfield after replacing cup-tied Jay Spearing. Booked for desperate challenge on Sterling. Williamson 7 . Tracked back really well and did his best to neutralise the threat of Coutinho. Could have given away a penalty in stoppage time for challenge on Joe Allen but referee made right decision. Marshall 7 . Creative force. Provided the ammo for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they looked to take advantage of an unfamiliar back-line. Unlucky to be denied by Simon Mignolet.

The former secretary of state and first lady kicked off her campaign, which was launched last week, in Iowa and will move on to New Hampshire on Monday.

'I'm proud of her,' Bill Clinton said of his wife to CNN reporter Ryan Nobles. Bill Clinton was in Oklahoma City to speak at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people including 19 toddlers at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. He addressed hundreds of people gathered at the site of the federal building to commemorate the dead, hailing the city as an example to the world of a strong and compassionate community. The service for survivors, victims' families, and other citizens began at 9.02am with a 168-second moment of silence followed by a reading of the names of those killed. 'I mostly came here to thank you today,' Clinton said. 'For a whole country you burned away all the petty squabbles in which we engaged leaving only our basic humanity.

{"document": "Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT HERE . Host commentator . Real Madrid are now just two points behind league leaders Barcelona. Chelsea may have wrapped up the title in England but it seems like the La Liga race will go right down to the wire. Real Madrid will have Hernandez to thanks for tonight's win as his two goals were decisive in their win over Celta. The home side the better side for large stages throughout the game but Real's quality in the final third made the difference. Yet another sign of respect by Ancelotti towards Celta. The Italian tactician now has six defenders on the pitch following the arrival of Arbeloa. Real Madrid now have three at the back with Carvajal and Marcelo acting as wing backs. Ancelotti's tactical switch shows just how much of a threat Celta have been during the 80-odd minutes or so. Hernandez will not get the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Ancelotti has decided to take the Mexican off. Pepe has been brought on to shore up the back-line. It's that man Hernandez again. Sergio Ramos runs up the pitch before playing a delightful through pass to Hernandez with the outside of his foot. The Mexican then takes one touch to bring the ball down before placing the ball into the net. A fine goal by the Real Madrid loanee. Some great football being played by Celta - and remember their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo. But they are inevitably leaving themselves wide open on the counter. An equaliser doesn't look far off as Real fail to get to grips with Celta. The away side continue to counter attack with Hernandez going close after a neat run from the halfway line. Real Madrid are playing with fire. The home side should have been given a penalty as Kroos has just swiped the legs of Orellana, who was racing towards goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti may have to freshen his side up during the next 10 minutes or so. They are still look far from convincing. Here's a reminder of who the Italian tactician can call on from the bench. Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Ronaldo has always scored against Celta Vigo whenever he has faced the La Liga outfit while wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He will be desperate to add to his outstanding tally of 39 league goals. No Bale and Benzema, no problem - Chicharito and James Rodriguez very good in the first half. Celta still in it but to play that well in the first 45 minutes and to go in at half time losing, it will be hard to lift themselves again. Real Madrid are extremely fortunate to be winning this game. Celta have looked assured and have really troubled their opponent's back-line. Nolito opened the scoring before Real took the lead thanks to goals by Toni Kroos and Javier Hernandez. Celta looked to be heading into the interval on level terms after Santi Mina's goal, however James Rodriguez struck before the break to make it 3-2 to Real. Real Madrid's luck appears to be in tonight as James Rodriguez has just scored an extremely fortunate goal. His shot is heading towards the arms of Sergio, in the Celta goal, until his shot deflects into the opposite corner and lands in the back of the net. Real do not deserve to be winning this game. Ronaldo almost puts his side back in the lead. The Portuguese forward races past Celta's defence before unleashing a low shot which looks destined to be heading for the back of the net. However his left-footed drives smashes against the post and rebounds to a Celta player. Remains 2-2. Barcelona will be delighted with the scoreline and Celta Vigo's performance during the opening 40 minutes of tonight's game. The home side continue to look the better side but they must be wary of Real's threat on the counter-attack. Real appear to be struggling in the absence of two members of the famous 'BBC' trio. They seem to be missing the pace of both Bale and Benzema in the final third. Not just because he's just scored, and not just because he scored four in one game two weeks ago, but 19-year-old Santi Mina is going to be one hell of a player. What is going on here? Just as we think Real are starting to find second gear - Celta go and grab an equaliser. This time it is Santi Mina who beats Casillas. He smashes the ball against the woodwork before tapping in the rebound from close range. One man who does seem to have taken confidence from the win over Atletico id Hernandez. He may have had to make do with a place on the bench during the majority of the season but he is now showing his worth. Hernandez shows a burst of pace before finishing past Sergio. I expected Real to come into this match with an extra bounce in their step following their win over Atletico but it has been the complete opposite. They look rattled and have really struggled during the opening 20 minutes of tonight's match. Second big assist in a week from Ronaldo. He's after his 40th league goal tonight. Celta have scored 38 as a team - that's what they are up against. It didn't take long for Real to get back on level terms. Ronaldo goes on a dangerous run down the right but fails to pick out a Real Madrid team-mate. The ball eventually falls to Kroos, who has the easy task of side-footing the ball into the net. Game on. Celta Vigo, who have started the brighter of the two sides, score by hitting Real on the counter attack. Nolito bursts down the left before cutting in between two defenders and shooting low past Iker Casillas. Fully deserved lead for the home side. Bright enough start from Celta. Ancelotti has not won here in any of his previous three visits with three different teams - Juventus, Milan and Madrid last season. Celta have started the match brightly with Real having to sit back and deal with their opponent's attacking threat. It looks like they will not be afraid of the European champions which should make for a good spectacle. Evidence shows that Real Madrid have a better win percentage without their Welsh wizard. Read Ben Nagle's piece on Bale's impact HERE. Manchester United's Javier Hernandez will lead the line for Real Madrid due to the absence of Karim Benzema.

{"document": "While Richie Benaud rose from the suburbs to captain Australia, he will be remembered forever for his mastery of commentating. The champion leg spinner turned cricket commentating into an art form, earning him the title of 'the Voice of Cricket.' His commentary was understated, measured and often extremely funny, and his one-liners were perfectly timed. Scroll down for video . 84-year-old cricket commentator Richie Benaud has passed away after a battle with skin cancer . His sayings from the hundreds of Test and One Day cricket matches he commentated on across the world were often what fans remembered from important moments. His signature one liners soon dropped to a simple word. 'Marvellous...' will forever be linked to the cricket legend. On commentating, Benaud said: 'My mantra is - put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' He once described the scene on the field: 'From our broadcast box you can’t see any grass at all, it is simply a carpet of humanity.’ On captaincy, and he was one of the best Test captains Australia ever had, Benaud was modest: 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.’ His commentary was understated and often extremely funny, and his one-liners were perfectly timed . The former leg spinner turned cricket commentating into an art form, giving him the title'the Voice of Cricket' But he cautioned that description with: 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don’t try it without that 10 per cent.’ When fellow leg spinner Shane Warne produced the so-called 'Ball of the Century' to dismiss English batsmen Mike Gatting, Benaud said: 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn’t know.’ But his mastery of understatement didn't mean he couldn't offer forthright opinions on the latest cricketing controversy. On Australian bowler Trevor Chappell's infamous underarm bowling incident in February 1, 1981, Benaud said: ‘It was a disgraceful performance … and it should never be permitted to happen again.’ He also wasn't afraid of the odd double entendre when cricketers came to grief on the field or there were some antics from spectators. His trademark word, 'Marvellous...' will forever be linked to the cricket legend . Once after a player had been hit in the groin, he said: 'Take away the pain, leave the swelling'. After a streaker ran on to the field: 'There was a slight interruption there for athletics.' Although comical on the pitch, off the pitch he was a serious man with a big heart. When Test and One Day cricketer Phillip Hughes tragically passed away, Benaud narrated a heartfelt tribute for the 25-year-old. 'A boy, just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green number 408. His father’s best mate, son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration… Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace, son,' he said. Back on the field, on a Justin Langer six he said: . 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' And will any commentator ever be able to match his tributes to a fine piece of play on the field?

Samantha Fleming and her newborn daughter Serenity were last seen in Anderson on April 5, when they left with a woman who said she was from Indiana's Department of Child Services, according to police. The three-week-old infant was discovered unharmed at a home in Gary on Friday and will be returned to relatives. Police have discovered a body they believe to be Indiana woman Samantha Fleming (left), who was reported missing with her newborn daughter Serenity (right) weeks ago in a city 180 miles away . In the same home, police found a body doused with bleach, wrapped in plastic and stuffed in a plastic storage bin, according to Lt. Thomas Pawlak. Police were led to Gary after Fleming's cell phone signal was picked up in the city, where the young mother's wallet was also found. Fleming was reported missing by her boyfriend. According to police, Fleming left the home they shared with her daughter Serenity after the woman who claimed to be from Child Protective Services told the new mother she had to appear at a hearing. Police said the woman told Fleming the hearing was at Lake Superior Court in Hammond, which is 13 miles from the home where the body was discovered. The infant was handed over to police by a woman who is believed to be the alleged kidnapper's sister, according to the Chicago Tribune. Police have not released the name of the woman. Pawlak said the woman had arrived at the house of the alleged kidnapper, who was not there, to pick up items for the baby. The house had a nursery. 'It appears that she had been planning this,' Pawlak said. 'There was everything you would buy for a new baby. A crib, changing table, diaper bag, carrier, new clothes.' According to police, the alleged kidnapper had asked her sister to care for the baby she was passing off as her own. That is the same story one neighbor of the woman said she was also told. The body was found on Friday in the 1900 block of Cleveland Street in Gary, Indiana. Police found a nursery inside the home and a neighbor said the owner of the house had said she was pregnant with twins . The neighbor told Chicago Tribune she was friends with the alleged kidnapper, who had told her she was pregnant with twins. The 36-year-old woman then told her neighbor around Easter that one of the twins had died after she had given birth, and that the other child was in the hospital with jaundice. When the neighbor eventually saw the woman with the child, she said she found the baby to be 'lighter-skinned' than she expected. The woman also had a bandage on her hand. The alleged kidnapper asked her neighbor to watch her house because she was going out of town. Just days before the woman left, the neighbor said she saw her going back and forth from her house to garage and carrying small plastic grocery bags. The neighbor said she and her friend had been texting regularly since the woman left. But when she texted the alleged kidnapper after she saw police enter her home on Friday, the messages stopped. The alleged kidnapper was located at a hospital in Texas. Police said she is a person of interest but has not yet been arrested. Pawlak believes the alleged kidnapper was very familiar with Fleming.

{"document": "Police in Western Australia  have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrest of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins. Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents, and according to the publication at least 300 police accessed the files. Acting Commissioner of West Australian Police, Stephen Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park.

Gangs of up to six follow wealthy shoppers in the West End before stealing their cash and belongings, according to the plain-clothes officers tasked with reducing theft in the area.

A bag they were carrying contained €130,000 and £20,000 as well as gold and diamond jewellery. London's busy shopping areas prove a big draw for gangs of pickpockets from around the world including Romania, Algeria and Bulgaria, reports Andy Jones on Vice. But DC Darren Bond, whose team monitors the Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street areas, explained to the the website that Chilean pickpockets 'don't mess about'. He is quoted as saying: 'They are intelligence-led – they don't go after anyone but wealthy tourists – and operate in mixed teams of three to six, often middle-aged. 'They will look like a nice family or group of businessmen to fit in. It allows them to walk through hotels unchallenged, sit down and have breakfast, then walk out with bags, laptops, etc. They are so hard to trace.' Plain clothes police are attempting to drive down pickpocket crimes in busy shopping areas like Oxford Street, pictured . He said many arrive in Britain on a six-month VISA before heading off on a 'European tour' and police are constantly monitoring CCTV to keep tabs on  gangs and their recruits. Organised international gangs of thieves will often spend a short time operating in London before flying to the likes of Madrid, Barcelona and Milan for the same purpose - all as part of moves to avoid detection. DC Bond, whose squad has seen a 50 per cent reduction in thefts over the last year, told Vice that 'anecdotally' about 70 per cent of arrested pickpockets were Romanians or Bulgarians, ten per cent Algerians and five per cent Chileans with the rest UK-based. 'Big city theft is now organised, international crime with bosses and a hierarchy,' he added.", "summary": "Gangs of South Americans target shoppers in West End, police have said .\nMany thieves arrive on six-month VISA before heading on a 'European tour'\nPolice arrested two Chilean women in burkas who had a bag containing €130,000, £20,000 and jewellery ."}
{"document": "Wladimir Klitschko has recalled his dramatic rise to the top on the eve of his world title defence against undefeated Bryant Jennings. The Ukrainian superstar will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years when he takes on the slick Philadelphian at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York. The 39-year-old Klitschko, though, has been reminiscing about how it all started for him when he won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996, instantly catapulting him into a hero in his home country over night. Reigning heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko (right) faces up to Bryant Jennings on Friday . 'I remember before I went to the Olympics and former Olympic champion in track running, [Valeriy] Borzov, he was Minister of Sports in the Ukraine said, 'Guys, you're going to the Olympics and one of you is going to win gold. That's going to change your life.' 'He was really right about it. I remember by winning the gold at the Olympics, when I came back home it completely changed my life. 'Sport definitely has power to change one's life and the world, as Nelson Mandela said. When I became champion of the world in the heavyweight division, that was 15 years ago, in 2000, and it was an amazing moment. Klitschko poses on the scale for the official weigh-in at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday . 'I do remember clearly how it was and it was additional motivation to keep doing what I was doing. I was only 24-years-old. I mean, very, very young, but I took it seriously and I was working up to it and I believed that my work was appreciated with my success in the ring and that I became champion.' WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Klitschko hasn't shown any signs of decline in recent times despite being just a year short of his 40th birthday. Still dominant and sitting high at the top of boxing's glamour division Klitschko believes age has no bearing on how long he can go on for. Klitschko will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years at Madison Square Garden . 'I definitely think that age is just a number. Actually, it's a big advantage instead of disadvantage because with the age you're getting better. With the right lifestyle there's nothing that can go wrong,' he added. 'I'm really happy about the preparation [for this training camp] and I'm happy that I'm an athlete and I can get in the peak of my performance thanks to my experience. I'm looking forward to Saturday night. 'My sparring partners were 23, 25, 27, 29-years-old. It's amazing and interesting that considering my age, I used to be the youngest in the gym all the time, and now it seems my sparring partners are much younger than me. I see myself in them and we work very well. Former heaxyweight boxing champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis were in attendance . Jennings, with a record of 19-0 with 10 knockouts, has been working on ways to nullify the well renowned Klitschko jab which he has utilised so effectively against past opponents. 'He has a great jab but I have an exceptional jab compared to his as well. He is one of the best athletes I've seen for that,' he said. 'There are definitely plenty of ways to actually get inside of a jab. Like lateral movement, head movement and relentless effort will definitely penetrate and make a change. 'I have 100 per cent confidence in everything that I do. I had a great training camp. The way that we actually prepare to manoeuvre around the jab, I feel is effective and I have 100 per cent faith in what we practiced. All I'm going to have to be is patient and be smart.'

{"document": "Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the Barclays Premier League next season after persuading the Old Trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of America in July. After last summer’s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America – in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans . United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy . United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer . While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England’s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend . Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league . The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter’s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America’s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America’s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.", "summary": "Manchester United will embark on a short tour of America this summer .\nThey are likely to spend 12 days on the west coast, staying in one place .\nUnited will defend their International Champions Cup title .\nLouis van Gaal has avoided a lengthy, energy-sapping tour this year .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news ."}
{"document": "A man charged with first-degree murder in the killing of three Muslim college students in Durham, North Carolina, can face a death penalty trial, a judge ruled on Monday. Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. said prosecutors had two aggravating factors and that Craig Stephen Hicks is 'death penalty qualified.' Hicks is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the February 10 killings of 23-year-old Deah Shaddy Barakat; his wife, 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha; and her sister, 19-year-old Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. Scroll down for video . A superior court judge in North Carolina ruled on Monday that Craig Hicks is 'death penalty qualified' after he was charged with first-degree murder in the killing of three Muslim college students . Prosecutors said Hicks confessed and was arrested with the murder weapon. Ballistics matched the handgun to shell casings recovered at the apartment and there was gunshot residue on his hands and one of the victim's blood was on his pants, prosecutors said. Police say Hicks, 46, appears to have been motivated by a long-running dispute over parking spaces at the Chapel Hill condominium complex where he lived in the same building as Barakat and his wife. The victims' families are adamant that they were targeted because they were Muslims and have pushed for hate-crime charges. The FBI is conducting what it has called a 'parallel preliminary inquiry' to the homicide investigation to determine whether any federal laws were violated, including hate crime statutes. Search warrants filed by Chapel Hill police said Barakat was shot in the head near the entrance to his condo. The two women were found in or near the kitchen. Murdered: Deah Shaddy Barakat, a dental student at the University of North Carolina; (left) his wife, 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha (center) and her sister, 19-year-old Rezan (right) were gunned down on February 10 . Eight spent shell casings were found at the crime scene, investigators said. Earlier search warrants listed a dozen firearms recovered from the condo unit Hicks shared with his wife, in addition to the handgun he had with him when he turned himself in after the shootings. Hicks, who was unemployed and studying to become a paralegal, posted online that he was an atheist and a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Neighbors described him as an angry man who had frequent confrontations over parking or loud music, sometimes with a gun holstered at his hip. His social media posts often discussed firearms, including a photo posted of a .38-caliber revolver.

{"document": "Boston bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev has been thrown another lifeline by two of his victims. Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the   2013 marathon, today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker, urging others to 'overcome the impulse for vengeance.' The couple's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight-year-old boy, Martin Richard, who was killed in the blast. His seven-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. This week, after finding Tsaernaev guilty on all 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, attack, a jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without parole. 'We must overcome the impulse for vengeance': Married couple Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes have joined the appeals calling for Dzhokar Tsarnaev to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death . Emotional: The couple who lost a leg each in the blast said their position is highly emotional and practical . Moving on: Here they are pictured completing the Boston Marathon in wheelchairs on the one-year anniversary . In a statement to The Boston Globe, Kensky and Downes said: 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance.' They call their position 'intensely emotional and profoundly practical.' The victims aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'. Like the Richards, Kensky and Downes call for life in prison without parole or appeals to ensure Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible.' The Richards made their appeal in a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published last Tuesday, just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death. While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. No to execution: The family of bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family is pictured on the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard . Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs . Brothers: Tsarnaev's (right) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his extreme older brother Tamerlan (left).  Tamerlan died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police . 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 . 'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. 'The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg. During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line. On the day the op-ed was published, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony. The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot.

{"document": "Rory McIlroy admits Thursday cannot come soon enough as he bids to complete the career grand slam by winning the Masters. The hype surrounding McIlroy's attempt to join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in winning all four major titles has been building since the night before his Open victory at Hoylake last July. And although the return of Woods to competitive action after two months on the sidelines has taken some of the spotlight off McIlroy, the world No 1 is anxious to let his clubs do the talking. Rory McIlroy insists he has arrived at Augusta ready to mount a serious challenge on the Masters . The world No 1 shields himself from the rain as he plays a shot during a practice round . 'I said in the middle of last week, 'If Augusta was to start tomorrow, I'd be okay. I'm ready,'' McIlroy said on Tuesday. 'I think that's a good indication of where I am with my game. I've been ready for this thing to start for a week already so just trying to keep my game where it is and do some quality work, not overdo it. 'Just do the right amount so that when I got here yesterday for the first time, I was ready to play and just needed to go see the golf course. I wasn't working on anything in my game, my swing. Wasn't thinking about technique at all. Just all about hitting the shots I need to and thinking about how to manage my game and get it around here for the next four days. 'Results-wise, the last three tournaments haven't been what I've wanted. I still feel like there's plenty of positives to take from them, especially Doral and Bay Hill, I felt like I played pretty good there. A couple silly mistakes here and there, but for the most part I felt like I got what I needed out of them. 'But the last two weeks have been great. I've just practised at home in Florida and made another trip up here a couple of Fridays ago. 'I just really felt like spending a couple of weeks away from this (media attention), I guess, and just preparing at home and in private and not really having everything critiqued and analysed and over-analysed. I just wanted to get away from it all, and I feel like it's been a good thing.' All eyes have been on Tiger Woods' latest comeback, which could take the pressure off of McIlroy . The Northern Irishman speaks to Wood's girlfriend Lindsey Vonn and his children during practice . McIlroy followed Woods into the media centre at Augusta National and admitted the presence of the 14-time major winner - who was relaxed and jovial with the press - could work in his favour. 'A little bit, I guess,' the 25-year-old added. 'It is such a big story, Tiger coming back at the Masters after a bit of a lengthy period where he has not been around. But still I'm just here to play golf and you guys can write the stories, I won't read them and we'll move on.' McIlroy has recorded just one top-10 finish in six previous appearances at Augusta - last year's tie for eighth - although he did take a four-shot lead into the final round in 2011 before collapsing to a closing 80. He admits he will have to play the par fives better to have a chance of slipping on a green jacket on Sunday, covering them in level par last year compared to eight under by champion Bubba Watson, who finished eight shots ahead. McIlroy led the field heading into the final day of the 2011 Masters before suffering a dramatic meltdown . McIlroy plays a shot from the azaleas as he recorded his best finish of eighth in last year's tournament . But he also believes Augusta National suits his game if he can take advantage of having a nine iron in his hands for second shots to holes like the 13th and 15th. 'I think I've developed a game where I can compete at pretty much any golf course now. That might not have been the case two or three years ago,' McIlroy added. 'But if you're looking at the courses, Augusta's the one that should set up the best for me just with my ball flight and being comfortable off the tee here, especially being able to turn the ball over from right to left. 'If I can play the way I know I can around here and just have a good week on the greens, then there's no reason why I shouldn't have a good chance.'", "summary": "World No 1 arrives at Masters hoping to complete a career grand slam .\nRory McIlroy insists he is 'ready' to win his final major at Augusta .\nNorthern Irishman admits Tiger Woods' comeback could work in his favour ."}
{"document": "St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands (CNN)Government officials are trying to track down vacationers who stayed at villas in the Virgin Islands who may have been exposed to a deadly pesticide. Local officials said methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in different parts of the island; even the governor said his condominium complex was fumigated with it in 2013, without his knowledge. Investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at the Sirenusa resort, where a Delaware family's vacation in paradise turned into a nightmare. Theresa Devine and Steve Esmond and their two children fell gravely ill and suffered seizures; two brothers, ages 14 and 16, remain in comas. But this was likely not an isolated incident. Local authorities here tell CNN there is evidence methyl bromide was used at least twice at the gated Sirenusa resort on St. John by the pest control company Terminix.  They also say Terminix used the pesticide across the islands on different occasions. Dawn Henry, the commissioner designee of the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources, or DPNR, said that while investigating what happened, the agency found methyl bromide was likely also used last fall at the same Sirenusa resort, as well as in a vacation villa in St. Croix and in two nontourist locations. Methyl bromide is banned from indoor use, and is only approved as an agricultural pesticide. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was. \"What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law and they'll be held accountable for it,\"  Mapp said. He said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013, but said there have been no additional reports of people falling ill. Authorities are trying to track down anyone who has stayed at the affected villas or who might have been exposed. Family slowly recovering from illness after Virgin Islands trip . Terminix issued a statement saying it is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" When CNN visited the Terminix office on St. Thomas, which is corporate-owned, an employee refused to comment, and another employee closed the door. Henry said all canisters of methyl bromide known to exist in the area have been confiscated and will be shipped off-island for destruction as soon as possible. In the meantime, an attorney for Esmond and Devine said the family is still struggling. The two teenage boys remain in comas. Their father has regained consciousness and is slowly getting better. Devine is in better condition and is undergoing occupational therapy. DPNR, the local environmental agency, already had been under scrutiny. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has oversight, designated it \"high risk,\" saying the agency \"does not meet management standards.\" The EPA's inspector general is also investigating. According to the Department of Justice, a former commissioner and two DPNR directors have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008. That year, Dean C. Plaskett  was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts. In 2014, Roberto Tapia, the Justice Department said, pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of that same agency.  He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison. In January, Mapp was sworn in and appointed Henry as a new designee to run the department, so it is under a new administration. A spokeswoman for the EPA said the DPNR has been cooperative in this investigation. She added that none of the troubles the agency has had are directly related to pesticide enforcement, but instead general practices. Mapp said the agency's problems have nothing to do with what happened to the Devine and Esmond's family. Instead, he blames the pesticide companies. \"It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it, and apparently in my own residence someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,\" Mapp said. Part of the investigation, he said, will be tracking whether the proper paperwork was filled out when the canisters were ordered, or if the pesticide was smuggled in. The Department of Justice is also investigating. \"If they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes, which is the only legal way they could use it, and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings, that's a clear and malice violation of the law,\" Mapp said.", "summary": "Methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, local officials say .\nTeen brothers exposed to the pesticide while on vacation are both in comas; parents are recovering ."}

And recently, supermodel Twiggy stood up for older women with long locks. ‘It makes me crazy when people say you have to cut your hair short once you hit 50,’ she said. ‘I saw a woman the other day in her late 70s with silver hair down to her waist. I thought, “Good on you, girl.”’ Here, some of Britain’s real-life Rapunzels show off their locks —and explain why they’d never consider going for the chop… . MY HAIR GETS STUCK IN CAR DOORS . Fiona Steane, 50, is an artist . She lives in London with her husband of 20 years, Christopher, 48, a banker, and their 17-year-old daughter, Amelia. Fiona Steane, 50, (pictured) wanted to cut all her hair off when she was 15 but her mother refused and she's had it long ever since then and gets it trimmed twice a year . My mother always kept my hair long. She had very long hair and she liked me to have it that way, too. I was dancing back then, so it was easier to have it long and whip it up into a bun. When I was 15, I wanted to cut it all off and my mother refused — so it’s been this way ever since. I don’t like watching people getting their hair cut and I hate hairdressers. I couldn’t even watch my husband getting his hair cut recently — there’s something about it that makes me feel sick. I get it trimmed, just getting rid of the split ends, twice a year. Then I have a conditioning treatment, which takes up to six hours but feels amazing afterwards. I don’t have a hairdryer. I’ve never used one. I don’t colour my hair. I don’t straighten it. I just shampoo, condition and leave. It’s pure laziness. This might look like it takes a lot of work but in reality I don’t have to do anything. I do make sure I use specialist hair products for long hair. When it comes to conditioner, I slather loads of it on. This keeps it nice and smooth. My cut-off point — when I know it’s got too long — is when I can sit on it. It gets stuck in car doors and it’s always in the way. Fiona (pictured) says she uses special clips from Paris to protect her hair when she wants to put it up . My hair is manageable at this length. When I want to put it up, I use special plastic clips from Paris so as not to damage my hair. An Arab man offered to buy my hair once. I thought it was hysterical. My daughter has beautiful long, thick hair. Hers is darker than mine but it’s stunning. I don’t like it when people touch my hair. I have to remind them that it’s mine. MY LONG LOCKS MAKE ME FEEL FEMININE . Sarah Rihal, 50, is a property manager from South London. She is married to Bob, 58, a pharmacist, and has two children, Alice, 27 and Jasmine, eight. Sarah Rihal, 50, (pictured) says she has had long her all her life and her youngest daughter Jasmine has hair the same length. Sarah says children in the school nursery often call her Rapunzel . I’m not a very girly girl but I’ve had long hair all my life. I went through phases when I was younger where I had shoulder-length hair, but since my late teens it’s been down to my bust. My youngest daughter, Jasmine, has hair the same length as mine. Jasmine has to wear hers plaited for school. When I pick her up, I often hear children in nursery whispering, ‘Look, it’s Rapunzel’ when we walk past. That makes me smile. I go to my hairdresser, Neil Ward, at his specialist salon Long Hair in London four times a year for a trim and conditioning treatment. The first time I went, I had my hair up in a metallic clip and Neil whipped it out and threw it in the bin. At home, I use a special shampoo and conditioner from the George Michael Long Hair range, as well as a cream rinse, which is like a conditioner that you comb through the ends after washing. I keep a jug of it in the bathroom, so I can just dunk the ends in after a shower. Sarah (pictured) uses a special shampoo from the George Michael Long Hair range, but she says there are practical difficulties with having long hair like having to plait it at night to avoid knotting . I wash my hair once a week — it does get greasy but it doesn’t usually need more than that. What I love about hair this length is that you don’t have to do anything with it. I wear it plaited or on top of my head in a bulldog clip. I just wash it and let it dry which takes about two hours. There are practical challenges to having long hair. And, at night, I have to plait it or it would get knotted around my pillow and my poor husband! My hair is my favourite part of myself. It is the one thing that makes me feel really feminine. I don’t think I’ll ever be tempted to cut it. Redheads like me tend to go white, not grey, so hopefully it will still look elegant in years to come. I GET PROPOSALS FROM STRANGERS . Melanie Brown, 60, is a retired teacher. Divorced, she has two grown-up daughters and lives in North London. Melanie Brown, 60, (pictured) says men have always found her hair attractive and that she has been proposed to twice thanks to her long locks . My hair started really growing when I was five years old and I’ve only been to a professional hairdresser twice as far as I can remember. The first time was when I was 15 and my hair was thick and long. The hairdresser cut it to my shoulders and that put me off for years. The second time was when I was in my 20s and I’d got my first teaching job. Headlice are a worry for teachers with long hair, so I marched to a hairdresser in London that specialised in long hair and said: ‘Cut it all off!’ They refused. They said it was so beautiful they wouldn’t dream of cutting it. Men have always found my hair attractive. I’ve had two proposals of marriage just because of my hair. One was from a colleague I’d only been working with for two weeks when he said he loved my hair and wanted to marry me. Not surprisingly, my ex-husband didn’t like the attention it got. Melanie (pictured) says she doesn't do anything special with her hair and washes it about once a week using whichever shampoo is cheapest . I really don’t do anything special to it. I wash it once a week with whatever shampoo is the cheapest on offer at Boots. I don’t use any special styling products, either. I just dry my hair with a hairdryer or, in the colder months when I have the heating on, I lie watching TV next to the radiator. Occasionally, I’ll get annoyed with it. But it’s part of ‘me’ now and I couldn’t imagine having it shorter. IT TAKES FOUR HOURS TO DRY NATURALLY . Vanessa Thorpe, 40, is a production editor. She lives in Essex and is divorced with one son. Vanessa Thorpe, 40, (pictured) will only use hair products that have not been tested on animals and washes and conditions her hair every morning despite the fact it takes four hours to dry naturally . I love having long hair, especially combined with its unusual colour. I don’t understand why some women feel compelled to cut their hair when they reach a certain age. I wash and condition it every morning, as it feels so much nicer. I never stick to one brand or product. I find my hair gets used to certain shampoos and conditioners and then they’re not as effective. I never buy expensive products. The products I’m using this week are Superdrug’s Pro-V, but before that I used Sainsbury’s own-brand. My only rule is that the products are not tested on animals. Vanessa (pictured) says she has never been tempted to go for a big hair cut but she has it trimmed every eight months where she has to stand up while they cut it . Washing it every day takes about ten minutes. Then I squeeze the water out with a towel and comb it through with a Tangle Teezer. It takes four hours to dry naturally, and I don’t use styling products. I’ve never been tempted to go for the chop. I had it hacked to shoulder-length when I was 13, but regretted it. I go for a trim about every eight months, and have to stand up so they can cut it. I don’t keep it this length to attract men, although I guess they like it. My boyfriend likes it, but I’d like to think he’s attracted to me and not just my mane.", "summary": "Most girls grow out of their yearning for tumbling tresses as adults .\nBut there is now a growing trend for middle-aged women with long hair .\nSupermodel Twiggy recently stood up for older women with longer locks .\nHere some of Britain's real-life Rapunzels show off their lengthy tresses ."}

Three years after the theft, police were investigating a car syndicate and executed a search warrant on a Wiley Park property. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, in a discovery described as 'quite remarkable' by police, all of the paintings along with three stolen luxury cars were found. $2 million worth of stolen artwork has been found in a caretakers garage after disappearing from Sydney home . The works were stolen in 2010 after being taken from property investor, Peter O'Mara's home in Darling Point . 18 paintings were taken from property investor, Peter O'Mara's Darling Point home along with a bronze statue and silver bowl. The items were stolen between July 17 and August 10, 2010. Mr O'Mara was paid $1,033,473 by his insurance company, Chubb Insurance after the theft. Last week's NSW Supreme Court judgment revealed the Wiley Park address was 'the residential home of the parents of a caretaker of Mr O'Mara's residence'. At the time of the theft, Mr O'Mara said, 'It's a gut feeling, but the whole thing had to be set up.' The discovery found works like Victoria and Moonlight by Charles Blackman . Capricorn Haze by Tim Storrier was also found during the raid and now belongs to Chubb Insurance .

{"document": "A missing schoolgirl was murdered by a 60-year-old man who called police two weeks prior to the killing to see how officers would react to her disappearance, a jury heard today. Robert Ewing, 60, was said to have had an 'inappropriate sexual interest' in 15-year-old Paige Chivers and took advantage of her 'chaotic and dysfunctional' upbringing which had left her 'very troubled and vulnerable'. He is accused of murdering the schoolgirl, from Blackpool, Lancashire, between August 23 and August 27, 2007. Scroll down for video . Robert Ewing, 60, is accused of murdering 15-year-old Paige Chivers (pictured left as a young schoolgirl and right aged 15) after she disappeared from her family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, in August 2007 . Police investigate a site in Thornton Cleveleys in Lancashire during an earlier search for Paige's body . Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home and, despite appeals from police and a £12,000 reward offer from TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found. Ewing was arrested in connection with her disappearance in September last year and is currently on trial at Preston Crown Court. The jury was told today how he allegedly rang police anonymously less than a fortnight before she went missing to tell officers that a 'problem child' had turned up on his doorstep having been thrown out by her father. Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told jurors that the Crown Prosecution Service believes he did so to 'test the water'. He told the court: 'We allege that he wanted to see what official reaction there would be to the suggestion of a 15-year-old girl turning up on the doorstep of a 52-year-old man and the answer he learned, we suggest, was very little reaction.' The court also heard how eight months after the schoolgirl's disappearance, Ewing's friend, Gareth Dewhurst, 46, was overheard in conversation saying he had used his car to dump the teenager's body. Mr Cummings said: 'He then went on to say: \"I didn't want to have sex with her, they made me\".' The prosecutor said a 'highly stoned' Dewhurst told a 16-year-old boy that Ewing had killed Paige and had then made him have sex with her before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body. Mr Cummings said: 'He (Dewhurst) said that he had put the body in the boot and was saying that he was going to set his car on fire. He was frightened that he was going to get arrested, or that Bob (Ewing) would kill him.' Paige (right) was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home (left) and, despite appeals from police and a £12,000 reward offer from TV host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found . Detectives hunting for Paige Chivers, who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago, dug up a farmer's field amid fears she maybe buried in a shallow grave but still no trace of her has been found . An extensive proof of life inquiry has not found any evidence Paige is alive and she has yet to claim a 'significant' inheritance sum left to her on her mother's death once she turned 18, the jury heard. The prosecutor said: 'The prosecution say that even though no body has been recovered, you can be sure that Paige Chivers is dead.' The court heard that Paige's father reported her missing on August 26 and clearly stated she was 15, but her date of birth was wrongly entered on the police system as 1962. 'In consequence, the matter was dealt with as though Paige were an adult aged 45 who had moved on voluntarily, rather than a girl of 15 who was worryingly missing from home,' said Mr Cummings. That approach was not corrected until September 7 when police inquiries then commenced, he added. Ewing, formerly of Blackpool, denies murder and intending to pervert the course of public justice by intimidating witnesses and providing false information to the police in their investigations. Dewhurst, of Blackpool, denies sexual penetration of a corpse and assisting an offender in disposing of a body. The trial continues.

{"document": "This is the spectacular moment a goose narrowly avoids a snapping fox’s jaw after the sly animal had given an almighty leap in a bid to take down the large bird. However despite the fox’s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide ‘with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day’s photography.’ However Mr Byng’s relaxing day’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. ‘I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,’ explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. ‘I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.’ Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. ‘The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. ‘It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. ‘Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . ‘It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. ‘The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!’ The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK.

{"document": "Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Gunmen stormed the headquarters of Somalia's education ministry in the country's capital on Tuesday after a suicide car bombing, a two-pronged attack that killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others, officials said. The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours. Among those killed was Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

{"document": "With temperatures creeping up, let’s celebrate with some ice cream. In fact, why not make your own? The choice of ice cream makers has never been wider. MANDY FRANCIS tried out the best brands on the High Street with some enthusiastic help from her children Stanley, 13, and Florence, eight. The Swan Come Dine With Me Ice Cream & Gelato maker is best for dinner parties . BEST FOR DINNER PARTIES . Swan Come Dine With Me Ice Cream & Gelato maker, £49.99, argos.co.uk . How does it work? This minimalist, cube-shaped machine looks sleek and impressive. The removable bowl — which has an inner, freezable gel layer — has to be frozen for eight hours before you put it back in the machine, then add the mixing arm, pop on the lid, and turn it on. As it starts to churn, you slowly pour in the mixture according to the recipe included — a basic one of egg yolks, cornflour, sugar, double cream and vanilla extract which has to be cooked and cooled in the fridge. Check the progress every five minutes or so, switching it off when it’s reached the texture you want. Is it any good? At two litres, this has one of the biggest capacities we came across, so it’s perfect for dinner parties and family gatherings. Unusually, the bowl rotates on this machine, while the mixing arm stays still — which looks clever, but creates a huge amount of noise. Stanley and Florence kept popping in to ask if it was ready — not because they were looking forward to eating it, but because they wanted the racket to stop! Fortunately the clattering was over in 20 minutes and the light, fluffy ice cream was really tasty. Verdict: Nice ice cream, shame about the noise. Having to keep a close eye on the machine until the ice cream is the right texture is a pain, too. Rating: . BEST FOR KUDOS IN THE KITCHEN . Sage Smart Scoop by Heston Blumenthal, £349.99, sageappliances.co.uk . How does it work? Sleek and polished, this looks like a breadmaker but weighs in at a huge 12.5 kilos (26lbs). Unlike other machines, it’s self-refrigerating (so there’s no need to freeze the mixer bowl before use). The leaflet recommends using a chocolate creme Anglaise (custard, to us regular folk) made from cream, milk, egg yolks, dark chocolate and sugar, which is cooled and poured into the bowl which sits within the machine. Then you pick from the 12 consistencies the machine can make (including sorbet, frozen yogurt, gelato and ice cream), turn it on and let the rotating paddle whip it together. Thirty minutes later, a litre of your favourite ice creamis ready. Is it any good? Beautifully smooth and truly delicious. We all licked our bowls clean. Best of all, the machine signalled that it was ready by playing a retro ice cream van jingle, which the kids adored. Verdict: A fantastic ice cream maker, but bulky and expensive. Rating: . The Sage Smart Scoop by Heston Blumenthal is a fantastic ice cream maker, but bulky and expensive . BEST BUDGET BUY . Shake n Make Ice Cream Maker, £14.99, thefowndry.com . How does it work? This looks more like a large plastic takeaway cup. Half-fill it with crushed ice and four tbsp of salt, then place your ice cream mix, a 50/50 blend of milk, single cream, flavouring and sugar, in the metal cone-shaped container which sits inside, screw it together and shake vigorously for three minutes. A neat, individual portion of ice cream should be waiting inside. Is it any good? A doddle for the children to use, and educational too — they loved learning how salt helps make the frozen dessert (it allows the very cold, melting ice to cover a greater area of the metal cone, if you’re interested). So we were disappointed to find little more than a frothy milkshake, despite three minutes of serious shaking from Florence. Stanley took over for two minutes, but the resulting thin, rock hard layer of vanilla ice cream had to be chiselled off the sides. A second attempt, with a four-minute shake, gave a more palatable result. Verdict: A fun gadget, but for all that effort, it’s a bit leaky and you only get a small portion. Rating: . Mandy's best for budgets is the Shake n Make Ice Cream Maker (left) but for kids the giant plastic 'ice cream cone' (right) from John Lewis is perfect . BEST FOR CHILDREN . Chill Factor Ice Cream Maker, £12.99, johnlewis.com . How does it work? This giant plastic ‘ice cream cone’ had the kids salivating before we’d even started. You simply freeze the soft, rubbery cornet section, which is lined with thick freezable gel, for four to six hours, then use the lid to measure out the ingredients recommended in the leaflet — in our case, just single cream, strawberry sauce and a little sugar. Then you tip the ingredients into the frozen cornet, screw the container back together and give everything a shake. Finally, you remove the top section of the lid and squeeze the cornet repeatedly for 30 seconds to encourage the ice cream to freeze and churn, before diving in — you can eat directly from the container with the long-handled spoon supplied, saving on washing up! Is it any good? It’s surprisingly well-made, considering the price, and really easy to use. We were all amazed at how quickly it transformed the contents into a sweet but slightly lumpy soft-serve ice cream. Clever. Verdict: A cute, well-made gadget that children will love. Rating: . Cute, pink and compact, this machine is designed to produce a smaller, 500ml portion of ice cream (that’s the same size as a tub of Ben & Jerry’s or Haagen-Dazs) BEST FOR PERFECT PORTIONS . Lakeland Mini Ice Cream Maker, £19.99, lakeland.co.uk . How does it work? Florence fell in love with this as soon as she saw it. Cute, pink and compact, it’s designed to produce a smaller, 500ml portion of ice cream (that’s the same size as a tub of Ben & Jerry’s or Haagen-Dazs). The removable bowl-shaped base also fits neatly in to my packed freezer. Once it’s thoroughly frozen (which takes about eight hours) you slot the lid, motor and paddle together and fix them on top of the base. Then you flick the on/off switch and slowly pour in your ice cream mix, in our case a cooked custard recommended in the handbook, made from whole milk, double cream, egg yolk, sugar and vanilla paste. Your ice cream should be ready in 15-20 minutes. Is it any good? As you’d expect from Lakeland, this is a high-quality, no-fuss product that delivers — neatly and without too much noise. The only downside? You need to keep an eye on it to get the texture of the ice cream just right. Verdict: A basic but handy little ‘everyday’ gadget. Rating: . BEST FOR RETRO FANS . Gourmet Gadgetry Retro Diner 3 in 1 Slush and Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker, £59.99, Robert Dyas . How does it work? At first glance, this Fifties-inspired machine looks more like a blender (or ‘a bubblegum dispenser’ according to my children). In fact, it makes and dispenses both soft-serve ice cream and slushy drinks, and has a tall aluminium ice cylinder inside the plastic vessel. First, you fill the aluminium cylinder with salt, ice and water, then put on the lid and set it to start mixing. As the paddles rotate, you pour your ice cream mixture — mine was a blend of condensed milk, double cream, whole milk, sugar, vanilla extract and mashed fresh strawberries — into the plastic casing, and watch as the combination of the icy central cylinder and stirring starts to create ice cream. At first glance, this Fifties-inspired machine looks more like a blender (or ‘a bubblegum dispenser’ according to my children) Once the ice cream looks ready, which takes approximately 12 minutes, turn the machine to ‘dispense’ mode for a stream of velvety soft ice cream. Is it any good? Super-easy to use, but quite noisy. We also had to remember to top up the ice as it melted before the ice cream had formed. But the kids loved dispensing the result, which comes out ‘Mr Whippy’ style. And they declared it ‘delicious’, although it melted too quickly for my liking. Verdict: A statement gadget — but it’s noisy, and you need to be quick before the ice cream melts. Rating: . BEST FOR A QUICK TREAT . Zoku Ice Cream Maker Bowl, £19.99, domu.co.uk . How does it work? A brightly coloured, plastic and metal bowl that allows you to make a portion of ice cream by hand. Freeze the metal bowl section that sits within the plastic casing for 12 hours in your freezer, return it to the plastic case and pour in your ice cream recipe. We used the recommended chocolate recipe, made with a little whole milk, cream, sugar, cocoa powder and a pinch of salt. Stir the ingredients and scrape the sides of the bowl continuously with the spatula-style spoon supplied and the frozen bowl will produce a delicious ice cream in under ten minutes. Is it any good? Stanley loved the idea of this, and he thought the bowl looked ‘cool’ once assembled (praise indeed from a 13-year-old). Yet after five minutes of stirring, he started to lose heart, as did I when the mixture splashed messily over the sides. After a bit more scraping and stirring, a solid white film of ice cream started to form on the steel bowl, and five minutes later, he had a generous portion of lovely, soft ice cream, into which he sprinkled a little grated chocolate. Simply delicious! Verdict: A fun, but slightly messy way to make and personalise your own ice creams. Requires elbow grease. Rating: .

{"document": "Suddenly, at the age of 34 and after 15 years of hoping for the exact opposite, I desperately wanted to get pregnant. My husband Russell was ready to be a father, we were financially secure and after editing a weekly magazine in New York for four stressful years, I was ready to resign and focus on building a family. Eleven months later, when my body was still not doing what I demanded, I got depressed, stressed and scared. Proud mum Sarah Ivens with her two children, William (left) and one-year-old Matilda (centre) 'Have I left it too late to have a baby?’ I’d wail impatiently to Russell as month after month I’d clutch at my abdomen in pain as my period started, filled with a burgeoning dread that my body was failing us. ‘I always put my career first, and travelling and having our dream wedding. Now I’m worried I’m too old.’ I was paranoid that my life decisions had left my baby dreams impossible to reach. During my pre-broody years I’d been bombarded with images of 40-something celebrities, gloating about how easy it had been for them to conceive naturally and quickly. Of course, horror stories in the tabloids tried to persuade me that I had about as much chance of procreating successfully after the age of 30 as I did of making it to The X Factor finals, but I had decided to follow the stars and wear blinkers. The truth, I was quickly discovering, lay somewhere in the middle of the heartbreak, guilt and misinformation women find themselves drowning in as they consider motherhood. Happy family: After years of heartbreak, Sarah and Russell have two children William, (centre) and Matilda . Pregnancy expert Zita West said: ‘I think in a way modern life has done women a disservice. ‘We’re told we can have it all, so women go on the pill while they are building their careers for many, many years, which masks any issues they may have such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis. 'Then when they decide to have a baby in their 30s, they are shocked if it doesn’t happen as they planned. 'We know that fertility starts to decline at 35 and that age is the biggest factor in a woman’s ability to conceive. Sarah and Russell celebrate their wedding with a dream day in the Cotswolds in 2009 . Expectant parents Sarah and husband Russell prepare for their son William's imminent arrival in 2011 . 'What women need to do immediately is ask their mothers what age they went through the menopause: this is a key genetic factor in your own fertility, and your cycle starts to decline rapidly 10 years before you hit the menopause.’ Eventually, Russ and I conceived - naturally - but at the 13-week scan, the other horrific factor of late motherhood reared its ugly head. Our baby had severe chromosomal abnormalities and had zero chance of survival. I was advised by a series of doctors to have a medical abortion, to safeguard my future fertility and mental state. ‘The sooner we get this unviable pregnancy dealt with, the quicker you can go on to conceive a healthy baby,’ our specialist advised us. This sounds callous, but even through the fog of utter devastation I knew he was being cruel to be kind: I didn’t have too much time. I was turning 35 in one month. A few days later, as I was wheeled into the operating theatre, tears streamed down my cheeks and neck and onto my pale blue hospital robe. Everyone was sad for me, but this was quite a common occurrence for a woman of my dotage. ‘Well, you have left it quite late, haven’t you,’ a few supposed sympathisers uttered in my direction when I was feeling sorry for myself. What had I expected? Preparing to be a new mum, Sarah poses at nine months pregnant with her son William, born in 2011 . Friends were as divided as the media when it came to declaring their true fertility stories. While one friend admits to leaving it too late and worrying herself to sleep each night over the mounting IVF treatment bills (her husband has insisted, scared of debt, she stop with the baby dream when they hit the £50,000 mark); another friend is determined to put off pregnancy until she has passed some professional exams. ‘I’ll only be 37 when I’m done – and if I have to re-sit, I can delay pregnancy another year easily,’ she tells me, perhaps naively. Another friend got joyously pregnant with her first child on the eve of her 40th birthday. Sarah celebrates the joy of having her son, William in 2011, after the grief of having to end her first pregnancy . Her husband – who was depressed at being made redundant – threatened to kill himself if she kept the baby. So she had an abortion, while he suddenly seemed to get better – better enough to leave her for a 20-something woman he met in his new job a few months later. ‘I’ll regret that choice for the rest of my life,’ she recently declared. ‘It wasn’t until my womb was empty and he’d gone that I realised I wanted a baby more than I wanted him.’ Other friends in their mid-to-late 30s are choosing to stick their heads in the sand. ‘If I get to 40 and I’m still single, I’ll get just find a sperm donor,’ is the flippant battle cry of many women I know. Some friends get pregnant as soon as they decide to start trying, of course, and those ones frustrate me the most. There is nothing noble in my frustration; I am despicably jealous – especially when these women don’t appreciate how lucky they are. So what can women who know they want to have children in the future do to safeguard their future fertility? ‘The medical profession is considering lifestyle more,’ says West. ‘Women and men need to look at their eating habits and whether they are under or overweight. 'A Body Mass Index of between 19 and 26 is ideal for protecting fertility health. Take multivitamins. 'Avoid fizzy drinks and processed foods; drink alcohol and caffeine in moderation and stop smoking and using drugs. 'All these things cause free radical damage, which harms your long-term chances of conceiving. 'There are no magic answers here; future parents just need to follow a healthy lifestyle.’ West also thinks women should address any psychological issues they have before trying to become a parent. Sarah's much longed-for son William, tenderly kisses his newborn baby sister Matilda . ‘Modern women are all about not getting pregnant, then suddenly a switch flips in their head at a certain age and they think they should be able to conceive immediately. Yet blockages exist and they need to ask themselves questions to stop their sub-conscious sending negative messages. 'How do you visualise your body? How do you connect with your womb?' asks West. 'I believe acupuncture, hypnotherapy and counselling can help a woman prepare her body for the journey towards motherhood.’ Now I am part of the envy-inducing club: I have two healthy children, a boy and a girl, although I did lose another pregnancy at 12 weeks in between their joyous arrivals. And that wonderful feeling is not something I’d want any woman who desires it to miss out on because she has been lulled into a false sense of security or stress due to the misinformation surrounding the issue of fertility today. ‘One day’ is a long way away. Take control of your options today.", "summary": "Journalist Sarah Ivens, 39, tells of her struggle to get pregnant aged 34 .\nThe mother-of-two tried for years before having a child .\nShe believes women need to be more aware of the difficulty of conceiving ."}
{"document": "A Missouri inmate was executed Tuesday night for killing a man in a fit of rage over child support payments 16 years ago. Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri. His fate was sealed after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down several appeals, including one claiming Cole was mentally ill and unfit for execution. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri and was pronounced dead at 10.24pm, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri . He declined to order a last meal and received the day's inmate tray meal of a turkey and bologna sandwich, a cookie and fruit punch. He did not provide a final written statement, the spokesman said. Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read the following statement from Gov. Jay Nixon: 'Next week marks the observance of Crime Victims’ Rights Week in Missouri, and tonight I ask the people of our state to especially remember Anthony Curtis, murdered by the man whose sentence was carried out tonight. 'Far too often, the names of those who are victims of violent crime, such as Anthony Curtis, are the names that are forgotten. 'Please join us in keeping Anthony Curtis and his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.' On Tuesday, Gov. Nixon refused a clemency petition that raised concerns about the fact that Cole, who was black, was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. Cole and his wife, Terri, were married for 11 years and had two children before divorcing in 1995. The couple fought about visitation and he was upset about child support payments, authorities said. By 1998, Cole was $3,000 behind in child support. Attorney General Chris Koster said Cole became angry when he learned that a payroll withholding order was issued to his employer, taking the money out of his check. 'Before I give her another dime, I'll kill (her),' Cole told co-workers, according to Koster. The first deduction appeared on his August 21, 1998, paycheck. Hours later, Cole forced his way into his ex-wife's home by throwing a tire jack through a glass door, Koster said. He was confronted by Curtis, a friend who was visiting. Andre Cole used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Curtis, then Terri Cole. Curtis died but Terri Cole survived. Cole fled the state but surrendered 33 days later. He claimed at trial that he did not bring a weapon into Terri Cole's house and that Curtis initiated the attack with a knife. Andre Cole's brother, DeAngelo Cole, 38, of Las Vegas, said the attack was out of character for his sibling. He called it a crime of passion. 'It was a one-time thing,' DeAngelo Cole said. 'He didn't have a history of that kind of behavior.' Cole's attorney, Joseph Luby, said Cole's mental health deteriorated during the more than a decade he spent in prison. He said Cole was plagued by psychosis and constantly heard voices in his head. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (above) in Bonne Terre, Missouri . The courts were not convinced. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the execution based on mental health concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned away appeals based on Missouri's secretive method of obtaining the execution drug pentobarbital and over how instructions were given to the jury. The jury itself was the source of the clemency request to Nixon. Advocates for Cole, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, said his case was among many in which St. Louis County prosecutors unfairly prohibited black jurors from hearing a death penalty case involving a black suspect. All 12 jurors in Cole's case were white. Kimber Edwards, who was scheduled for execution in May, was also convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. The Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation, canceled the execution orders for Edwards earlier this month. Missouri tied Texas for the most executions in 2014 with 10.

{"document": "Conrad Clitheroe, left, and Gary Cooper, right, were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in Dubai . Three British men who have spent two months in prisons in Dubai and Abu Dhabi after they were seen plane spotting are to be freed. Conrad Clitheroe, 54 and Gary Cooper, 45, from Stockport, along with their ex-pat friend Neil Munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport. They were taken to a police station and despite being told they would not be detained, were put into prison. Families of the three men confirmed they had been told they would finally be able to return home and charges of espionage would not be brought against them. Attorney Nasser Hashem said the men would be free to go after the court accepted a defense argument that they were pursuing their passion for plane spotting and had no ill intent. The news means Mr Clitheroe, who suffers from a heart condition, will be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife Valerie on May 9. She said: 'I am absolutely ecstatic. Apart from our wedding and the birth of my children this is the best day of my life. 'I just can't wait to see him, to hug him, to hold him. 'We got a call from the lawyer at 10am today to tell us he'd been in court and the case had been dropped. 'We then confirmed it with the consulate. 'I am just so happy, we've been ringing everyone to let them now. I'm in a bit of shock too, I don't feel like it can be real. 'How can you hold someone for that long with no charges? I don't understand it but I'm so so glad.' Earlier this month Mrs Clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication. The men had travelled to Dubai for a four-day holiday on February 18. All three friends were keen to see Fujairah Airport, which is used by older and rarer aircraft. They drove the 70-mile journey there on February 21, but were stopped by an off-duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes. Mr Clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs. Although plane spotting is not illegal in the United Arab Emirates, it is not understood and is frowned upon. Mr Clitheroe posted this picture on February 19 as he pursued his hobby at the Sheraton Deira Hotel in Dubai . The men were taken to a police station, where they were allegedly told they could only leave if they signed a form in Arabic saying they would not practise their hobby there again. But after signing the document, without asking for a translation, they were kept in custody overnight. They were brought before a prosecutor the next day and then moved to Fujairah Prison. Their case was escalated to a matter of 'national security'. Sharing a cell with over 20 others, eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day, the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as Mr Clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition. Valerie Clitheroe (pictured with her husband) said both he and Mr Cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release . A judge last month extended their custody licence, which was up again on April 12, but an admin error delayed the hearing until today. Mrs Clitheroe, who had recently written to the Prime minister for support, added: 'Conrad was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released. Things had seemed to be so against them from the start that they thought it was going to end badly. 'We thought they would be charged with something and fined so it's come as a shock that there are no charges at all. We had started planning to go out there to deal with the lawyers face to face.' Mrs Clitheroe said the men had been keen plane spotters since they were children. The men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport . The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper were helped by charity 'Detained in Dubai' to pay £9,000 for a lawyer to fight their case. A crowd-funding site set up by the men's work colleagues has raised more than £5,000. Today Radha Stirling, the founder of Detained in Dubai said charges of espionage against the trio had finally been dropped at the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. 'The charges are being dropped with no fines or penalties. They've had a long time to wait to be told your case is ridiculous,' said Ms Stirling.", "summary": "Conrad Clitheroe, 54, and Gary Cooper, 45, were taken to a police station .\nThey were told they would be allowed to leave if they signed Arabic form .\nBut they were held in prison along with friend Neil Munro for two months .\nOfficials confirmed today that charges of espionage against them dropped ."}

But Ukip’s reputation for telling it straight was left in tatters this morning after the party’s deputy leader was caught posing for a photograph to make him look more educated – in front of a photoshopped library clutching a picture book. Mr Nuttall, Ukip’s education spokesman, appeared in the party’s manifesto in thick-rimmed glasses holding a book called ‘British Rebels and Reformers’. The vintage hardback is listed on Amazon as a 48-page illustrated history book from 1942. Scroll down for video . Paul Nuttall, Ukip’s education spokesman, appeared in the party’s manifesto in thick-rimmed glasses holding a book called ‘British Rebels and Reformers’ - a vintage hard-back picture book . Mr Nuttall stands in front of shelves stacked full of books – many of which, on closer inspection, are the same and have been photoshopped to make the library look bigger. After being ridiculed on Twitter, the MEP joked that the photoshop allegations were not true: ‘I just have two copies of every book.’ The bizarre row capped a day of confusion for Ukip after the party's immigration spokesman appeared to contradict her own border policies. Suzanne Evans appeared to contradict a flagship policy on banning non-skilled workers after telling the manifesto launch that the party did not want to 'pull up the drawbridge' but only 'control who walks over it'. Mr Farage hoped to get Ukip's election campaign back on track, promising help for first-time buyers, military veterans, small businesses and hospital patients. The books behind Mr Nuttall were clearly photoshopped, appearing in mirror image next to each other . The Ukip deputy leader later took to Twitter to joke about the allegations, insisting he just had 'two copies of every book' But the attempt to present a more professional image risks being over-shadowed by falling poll ratings, rivals openly vying for the Ukip leadership and chaos over the party's flagship immigration policy. In remarks which risk angering supporters opposed to immigration, Mrs Evans said: 'Ukip is not anti-immigration. Immigrants are not the problem. It's our current immigration system that is the problem. Nigel Farage unveiled Ukip's manifesto in Thurrock, Essex, this morning . 'We will not pull up the drawbridge, we will simply start to control who walks over it.' Today it emerged Ukip has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten. The party reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. In a speech in Essex, Mr Farage claimed Ukip could hold the balance of power after May 7. He said: 'We are the only party with the self-confidence and belief in this nation that we actually believe that not only could we, but that we should, govern our own country, make our own laws and negotiate our own international trade deals. 'We are the only party standing in this General Election saying we want a trade deal with Europe, we want to be good neighbours with our European friends, but we desperately seek a referendum so that we can set this country free from political union. 'There is no third way. There is no renegotiation of any value that is to be had in Brussels. Our position is perfectly clear - We want our country back.' He set out key polices he would demand as a price for supporting a Tory government. They include: . An in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership 'as soon as possible' An Australian-style points-based immigration system . More than 2 per cent of GDP to be spent on the armed forces . Guaranteed jobs in the police, prison, or border force for anyone leaving the forces after 12 years .

No income tax on the minimum wage up to £13,000, a new 30p tax band on earnings between £45,300 and £55,000, with the 40p tax band kicking inn at £55,000 . However in the latest sign of policy chaos, the manifesto includes a pledge to limit net migration to 50,000. Mr Farage has previously warned caps and targets are 'ludicrous' and over-ruled his immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe who said the party would put a figure on the number allowed into the UK. Meanwhile Suzanne Evans, the party's deputy chairman, appeared to ditch a key policy on banning unskilled migrants in the space of just 60 seconds.", "summary": "Ukip have claimed to be the only party fighting Westminster political PR .\nBut the deputy leader Paul Nuttall posed for a photoshopped picture .\nMr Nuttall was pictured clutching a vintage picture book from 1942 .\nRows of books are behind him - photoshopped to look like there are more ."}

{"document": "One in five American women are willing to undergo dangerous beauty treatments in order to achieve the ideal look, despite the risks that these procedures pose to their health. According to a new study, while just over half of women worry about the long term damage of beauty treatments, nearly a fifth would still pursue a treatment to get the right look - even it it proved hazardous to their health. Seven per cent, meanwhile, have actually had allergic reactions. The survey, conducted by beauty research organization LQS and Associates, looked at the lengths 1,000 American women go to in order to enhance their appearances or copy a celebrity, and the potentially disastrous consequences they might face in doing so, including hair loss, skin swelling, and overly painful procedures. The cost of beauty: Women often don't realize the dangers of salon treatments before sitting in the styling chair . Respondents cited the hairstyles of actresses Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock, as well as signer Jennifer Lopez, as celebrity favorites, with 53 per cent also noting that they get skin, beauty, and hair ideas from pictures and videos of famous personalities. But LQS and Associates warns against attempts to emulate these looks on a regular basis. A-listers like Beyonce, Paris Hilton, and Selena Gomez all sport weaves and extensions, but their beauty regimen is not always adaptable to the average person. 'Many of those glamorous looks can do more harm than good, leading to long term problems,' said LaQue Gushon-Harris, president of LQS and Associates. 'Unfortunately, most women are not even aware of the repercussions.' Mr Gushon-Harris explained that women who get weaves and extensions often deal with hair loss from traction alopecia, the gradual recession of the hairline due to tight hairstyles that pull at hair follicles over time. The survey also revealed that the top five beauty and cosmetic treatments favored by women in the US include manicures, pedicures, hair coloring, teeth whitening, and perms. However, frequently demonized treatments like tanning beds and facials also make the top 10. Good hair day: Jennifer Aniston (left) and Sandra Bullock (right) have the top two favorite celebrity hairstyles . Long-term risk? According to LaQue Gushon-Harris, president of LQS and Associates, Beyonce's weave could be causing permanent damage to her hair follicles . Despite the dangers, the majority of women say beauty treatments make them feel better about themselves and improve their looks. Nearly half believe these procedures boost their confidence. And in a country where one-sixth of women go to great lengths to look like their favorite celebrities, knowledge of dangers might not even stop them. When asked if they knew for certain that their treatments would cause permanent damage, four per cent said they would continue anyway and six per cent would continue, just not as much. Most women, however, remain confident that their treatments are safe, and 67 per cent say they would stop if they learned what they were doing to themselves was unhealthy. It comes down to education, says Mr Gushon-Harris, who travels the country teaching women about the dangers of cosmetic treatments. The study also found that 56 per cent of the respondents want more information on the side effects of their treatments and almost a quarter don't have any idea of the dangers of their treatments. It's a possible push for beauty salons to be more transparent. 'It is very important to be educated about whatever it is that you are doing to your body,' he added.

{"document": "(CNN)It's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer, Michael Slager, gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named Walter Scott after a traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina. And the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation -- along with the prompt arrest of Slager on murder charges -- is a welcome and appropriate response. But the event raises broad, troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of a third-party recording. It's not supposed to be a mystery: More than 20 years ago, Congress approved a law, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, signed by President Bill Clinton, that requires the federal Justice Department to collect data on deaths caused by police. The law has never truly been implemented, leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in America. \"What happened here today doesn't happen all the time. What if there was no video? What if there was no witness -- or hero, as I call him -- to come forward?\" said L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for Scott's family. \"As you can see, the initial (police) reports stated something totally different.\" That's putting it mildly. In early police statements -- issued before the video came to light -- Slager reportedly said that Scott attacked him, that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive Scott. The video makes hash of those claims, and likely contributed to Slager's swift arrest and pending murder charges. \"When you're wrong, you're wrong,\" said North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey. That leaves Slager to face murder charges that could land him on death row -- and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality. I'm all for having police use body cameras, although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force. But the much bigger problem is that we simply don't know when and where police killings take place, or whether they cluster in particular cities or states. And that means we don't know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias. We don't even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness. These vital questions aren't supposed to be a mystery. According to Section 210402 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, \"The Attorney General shall, through appropriate means, acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers. ... The Attorney General shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section.\" That section of the law has effectively been ignored, beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in 1996. By 2001, a New York Times article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force, \"No comprehensive accounting for all of the nation's 17,000 police department exists.\" There are multiple reasons the law has been ignored. Collecting information from the nation's thousands of jurisdictions -- the myriad villages, counties and cities -- is a tough, expensive assignment. The job is even harder because many police departments, reluctant to air their dirty laundry, fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it's up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that's often established only after years of court proceedings. These hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from Washington, but Congress has failed to press the Justice Department to demand the data and comply with the 1994 law. A weak substitute called the Death in Custody Reporting Act was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014, but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments. Some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations -- and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular, mandatory enforcement of the data-gathering law. In 2011, the Las Vegas Review-Journal published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around Las Vegas and found 378 shootings over a 20-year period, 142 of which were fatal. In no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on-duty shooting. In South Carolina last month, The State newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects, and found that only a handful of officers were charged, and none found guilty. \"In South Carolina, it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone,\" the Columbia newspaper concluded. A group of activists has created a website called MappingPoliceViolence.org that flags cases of police killings; its estimate that at least 304 black people were killed by police in 2014 may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem. But we shouldn't be guessing. As the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorialized in 2011: \"How many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings? How can they know about a potential local problem without information? ... Police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder, and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute. The budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule. The social impact of such an addition, however, would be huge.\" That common-sense observation is being echoed by the Obama administration -- specifically, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, created in December in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The recently released interim report of the task force calls, one more time, for the Justice Department to collect comprehensive data from local departments. But it will take more pressure -- from activists, victims' families, members of Congress and President Barack Obama himself -- to demand an end to the stonewalling of information. It's long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like Walter Scott's are happening without a video to set the record straight.", "summary": "Errol Louis: By chance a bystander video caught South Carolina officer shooting apparently unarmed black man .\nFederal law on reporting of such shootings goes unenforced -- how many instances do we never hear about? he asks .\nLouis: It's long past time for officials to tell the truth -- even when there's no video ."}

Duke Walker told AL.com that ten vessels were capsized or incapacitated during the storm with three of those with the regatta. Walker also said crews are using boats and airplanes to search vast portions of the bay, including the center and areas close to Dauphin Island where family members have gathered. The storm rolled through the area about 4pm and a man was plucked from the waters by the Coast Guard around 9pm, Petty officer Carlos Vega said. Families of those missing stayed overnight in a makeshift shelter hoping that on Sunday morning they would be reunited with their loved ones, according to AL.com. Survivor Robert Luiten was a member of a five-person crew with also his  18-year-old son, Lennerd when they were thrown into the bay after the storm hit.

Mather was not in the race and was able to pull three people onto his vessel about two miles north of the Dauphin Island Bridge. He said the boaters seemed extremely tired but none of them were injured. 'They were exhausted but they were fine,' he said.

Tanya Peacher, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, said she'd never attended a protest in the city before, but watching a video of Gray's arrest motivated her. 'I looked at my son,' she said, 'and thought ''that is my son.'' Late on Friday, Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the department's policy.. Freddie Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . Before the protest turned tense, people held signs with slogans such as 'Jail Killer Police!' and 'Unite Here!' Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured. Video showed him being dragged into a police van and police have said he rode in it for about 30 minutes before paramedics were called. Six officers involved in the case have been suspended with pay pending the results of an investigation that includes an independent review. On Saturday, residents young and old, from Baltimore and beyond, gathered around noon and voiced their anger at how the department and the city's officials are handling the investigation into Gray's death. At one point, the crowd paused for a moment of silence in front of Shock Trauma, the hospital where Gray died. The marchers then migrated to Camden Yards. At a downtown intersection, a dozen marchers laid down in the street during an impromptu 'die-in.' The police department has conceded Gray should have received medical attention when he asked for it . People lay in the streets on Saturday afternoon mimicking the way Gray was held as he cried for help during his arrest . Wearing a sign around his neck that said 'I am Freddie Gray,' 33-year-old Dante Acree joined thousands of others outside City Hall.

{"document": "Rescuers were forced to abandon their efforts to save 149 dolphins that were stranded on a beach in Japan after working tirelessly all day to help the creatures. As darkness fell on the beach in Hokota, around 60 miles northeast of Tokyo, coastguards and officials called off the rescue operation after only managing to save three of the 149 melon-headed dolphins that had beached. The rest of the animals had either died or were dying, they said. Scroll down for video . Rescuers managed to save three dolphins, but the remaining of the beached pod are 'dead or dying' A volunteer pours water on a dolphin to stop its skin drying out. Others were being carried back to the ocean . Workers use a crane to remove one of the 146 melon-headed whales that died when beached in Hokota . 'It was becoming dark and too dangerous to continue the rescue work at this beach, where we could not bring heavy equipment,' a Hokota city official said. 'Many people volunteered to rescue them but the dolphins became very, very weak.' 'Only three of them have been successfully returned to the sea, as far as we can confirm,' he added. Volunteers from local communities had joined forces with coastguards to try and save the dolphins, pouring water on them to stop their skins drying out. They also used slings to carry some back into the water, after they were seen early on Friday morning on the beach writhing in pain. But despite desperate efforts to help the melon-headed whales, some  were being pushed back onto the beach by the tide soon after being released. The creatures are usually found deep in the sea but have mysteriously beached about 60 miles northeast of Tokyo. Volunteers and residents living nearby used slings to carry the dolphins - but some were carried back to shore . Young children look at melon-headed whales beached on the shore of Hokota city, northeast of Tokyo. Scientists say they are not sure how the dolphins ended up on the beach but believe they might have got lost . The location of Hokota where the dolphins beached. It is now thought 150 creatures are on the beach in Japan . Television footage showed several animals had been badly cut, and many had deep gashes on their skin. Speaking earlier today a coastguard official said they are aware a number of the sea creatures have died. 'We see one or two whales washing ashore a year, but this may be the first time we have found over 100 of them on a beach,. he added. A Hokota city official said they had counted 149 dolphins, revising an earlier figure of 130. Three had been successfully returned to the sea by the late afternoon, he added. Coastguards covered the dolphins in blankets and put them on a boat so they could be put back in the sea . The Japanese Coast Guard worked nonestop to save the melon-headed whales, part of the dolpin family . The creatures usually live in the deep ocean, but for an unexplained reason had become beached on the shore . Dozens of volunteers and local residents turned out to help coastguards with the dolphin rescue operation . The pod of dolphins was stretched out along a roughly six mile-long stretch of beach in Hokota, Ibaraki, where they were found by locals early on Friday morning. While the reason for the beaching was unclear, Tadasu Yamadao, a researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said the dolphins might have got lost. He explained: 'Sonar waves the dolphins emit might have been absorbed in the shoals, which could cause them to lose their sense of direction.' Melon-headed whales, also known as electra dolphins, are relatively common in Japanese waters and can grow to be two-to-three meters (six-to-nine feet) long. Dolphins emit sonar waves, but researches say if these are absorbed they can lose their sense of direction . The rescue operation is in stark contract with Japan's stereotypical attitude towards whales, which are hunted . In 2011, about 50 melon-headed whales beached themselves in a similar area. The dolphin rescue that took place on Friday was a stark contract to the Japan's reputation towards its sealife, as the country continues to hunt minke and pilot whales despite international criticism. It has never made any secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed. Japan also defies international opinion with the annual slaughter of hundreds of dolphins in a bay near the southern whaling town of Taiji. The killing was brought to worldwide attention with the Oscar-winning documentary 'The Cove'.", "summary": "Pod of melon-headed whales beached in Hokota, 60 miles from Tokyo .\nRescuers worked tirelessly to save creatures, but only three survived .\n146 helpless dolphins were 'dead or dying' as rescue operation called off .\nScientists believe creatures ended up on shore after being disorientated ."}

{"document": "Millions of Americans avoid inviting people round because they are embarrassed about the state of their homes. According to new research, 61 per cent of US adults have admitted that they don't extend invitations to friends and family because of their 'home shame'. General mess, dated carpets and kitchens, unfinished DIY projects and the small size of their property rank highest on the list of embarrassments - which awful color schemes, shabby furniture and poor location also proved to be particularly shameful for homeowners. Shame: More than 60 per cent of Americans have admitted to being ashamed of their own homes . In a study of 1,000 people for Sugru, makers of moldable glue, 48 per cent said their embarrassment about their home is usually confined to just a few rooms or areas, however 33 per cent acknowledge they are ashamed of their whole house. 1.Mess . 2. Dated carpets . 3. Dated kitchen . 4. Dirty/stained carpets . 5. DIY jobs that haven't been started . 6. Bad smells . 7. Size . 8. Cracked walls/ceilings . 9. Badly decorated . 10. Faded or peeling paint . 11. Old/broken furniture . 12. Patchy lawn . 13. Too much clutter or trash . 14. Incomplete DIY jobs . 15. Bad/anti-social neighbors . 16. Dated/shabby wall paper . 17. Overgrown yard . 18. Mold or mildew patches . 19. Bad location . 20. Bold/garish color schemes . More than half haven't let visitors in to certain rooms, and 36 per cent steer people away from coming to visit altogether. Interestingly, more than half of the participants (54 per cent) admitted that it is their friends whom they try to avoid inviting over, while 38 per cent were more concerned about having strangers visit their humble abodes; 33 per cent on the other hand are most concerned about work colleagues taking a peek at their home. Top on the list of cringe-worthy rooms is the living room, followed by the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. What's worse, 62 per cent worry they will never get their home to the point where they are no longer ashamed by it. Sugru spokeswoman Jane ni Dhulchaointigh said of the survey: 'When you first move into a house, most people have ideas about how they want to make it their ideal home. 'But a lack of time, money and even basic DIY skills can mean many struggle to see all, or even any of these plans through. 'Sometimes all it takes are a few minor changes here and there. Start small with a DIY project that you're going to actually enjoy, with simple tools that you're confident using and focus on one room at a time. 'The pride that you'll get from one successful project will help spur you straight on to the next.' According to the survey, a whopping 30 per cent of people have actually pretended to be out when someone they knew knocked on their door, and 14 per cent admit that they have had someone drop them off elsewhere rather than allowing them to see their home. A further 39 per cent, at one point or another, have avoided hosting an event at their home. Nearly a quarter of people surveyed (21 per cent) also admit to ending a date early rather than inviting their date back to their home. Envy: Many Americans confessed that they would love the chance to take a look inside the Obama family's private living area . LIfestyle guru: Martha Stewart's home topped the list of celebrities houses people would most like to see inside . The study found that 63 per cent have plans to improve their home, with 18 per cent saying the motivation for getting it done is based on pure embarrassment. Other motivators for wanting to work on their home include time off from work, upcoming visits from family and friends and looking at homes on TV. 1. Martha Stewart . 2. The Obamas' living quarters in the White House . 3. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie . 4. Jennifer Aniston . 5. Oprah Winfrey . 6. George Clooney/Lake Como . 7. Taylor Swift . 8. Ellen Degeneres and Portia De Rossi . 9. The Playboy Mansion . 10. Madonna . And when it comes to celebrity home envy, it was lifestyle guru Martha Stewart's home that topped the list of houses the participants would most like to see, while the Obamas' living area in the White House and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's home placed second and third respectively. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 46 per cent of respondents admitted that they are struggling to make the changes they would like to their home because it costs too much money, while 23 per cent say they're not making improvements because they are planning to move soon. 16 per cent admit they don't know how to fix or repair what needs to be fixed to make their homes look presentable. An overwhelming 88 per cent would feel less embarrassed about the state of their home if they could redecorate all or part of their home, or at least get those pesky DIY jobs done. Ms ni Dhulchaointigh adds, 'We are all busy, which often leaves less time to pay attention to those small home improvement jobs. 'That's why we've created something that makes quick fixes, repairs and improvements easy. It's all about making people's lives simpler and getting that home pride back.", "summary": "Many people also confessed that they would love to take a tour of lifestyle Martha Stewart's home, as well as the Obamas' private living area ."}

The Portuguese was booked after being brought down by Rayo defender Antonio Amaya inside the box, incurring a one-game suspension in the process. But Ronaldo is now free to start at the Bernabeu after La Liga's appeals committee decided that he had been unfairly punished at the Estadio de Vallecas. Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to be unfairly cautioned after he was chopped down by Antonio Amaya . The Real Madrid star was set to miss Saturday's game with Eibar but his yellow card has now been rescinded . Ronaldo was furious after being booked during Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday . Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez will miss Saturday's game after picking up bookings against Rayo but Real immediately decided to appeal the yellow card for their star forward. Speaking after the game, Carlo Ancelotti said: 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.'

{"document": "It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon’s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend – again – that England’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus. For the umpteenth time, the RFU and Stuart Lancaster are being urged to invoke the ‘exceptional circumstances’ get-out clause. There is an assumption in many quarters that, this being a World Cup year, it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every Englishman, wherever he may be, is available for selection. Well, here’s an alternative suggestion. Scrap the clause. Now. It is proving to be more hassle than it is worth. Lancaster, his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for Armitage to be called into the national squad, as befitting his supreme exploits for Toulon. But that is to ignore the coaches’ reservations, and the realisation that the fall-out from a shift in policy would have long-term repercussions. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon was outstanding for Clermont as they tore Saracens to shreds . Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been one of the standout forwards in Europe in recent seasons . Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea believes the 'exceptional' clause could cause major problems . England hooker Tom Youngs also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set-up . This is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the Galacticos at his club, but this situation cannot go on. England are being held hostage by their own edict, so why not just ditch the ‘exceptional’ clause and end the out-cry? Critics of the union’s stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place. This column concurs with Conor O’Shea, who said: ‘It is pure populism to say it is World Cup year and we should do anything we can because the minute you break that (policy), you break the dam. There are always exceptional circumstances. Then there will be the next one and the next one and the next one.’ Leicester’s England hooker, Tom Youngs added: ‘I don’t know how well it would go down with the team. Stuart has built a culture with this group of players. Does he want to disrupt it?’ The 'exceptional' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff . Fair point. Tell players they have to stay to be considered, then at the 11th hour perform a U-turn and select exiles; that is a short-cut to unrest, surely? This is no restraint of trade either – those who wish to go abroad can do so freely, but the knock-on effect is clear. Well, it is reasonably clear. It would be clearer still if the RFU and England really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely. Sam Burgess’s heavily-scrutinised conversion to rugby union will take an intriguing twist on Friday night, when he starts at blindside flanker for Bath against Newcastle at Kingston Park. He has been striving to make an impact in midfield for four months, but his club’s head coach, Mike Ford, insisted long ago that back row would be his ultimate home. There are potential implications for Burgess’s quest to earn a place in England’s World Cup squad, as Lancaster sees him as a candidate to play at inside centre. Sam Burgess's rugby evolution continues on Friday as he starts at blindside flanker against Newcastle . However, despite widespread misgivings about the former league icon’s exploits to date in his new code, he will be included in England’s training squad announced next month, providing he is fit. That is a given. In addition, any further doubts about Manu Tuilagi’s health will further enhance Burgess’s prospects of making it to the World Cup – as a powerful ball-carrier who can break tackles and off-load. The England coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision, given three months to do so. Finally, the back-row experiment makes sense. Burgess needs the ball in his hands more, in order to make his presence felt, so wearing No 6 addresses that. When it comes to matchday atmosphere, the Stade Marcel Michelin is hard to beat . It is well documented that English clubs cannot compete with their French rivals when it comes to transfer-market clout, but they are also being eclipsed in the atmosphere stakes too. Last weekend, the cacophony at Stade Marcel Michelin – for Clermont vs Northampton – was on a different level to anything experienced here. In this observer’s opinion, the noise and colour at Stade Felix Mayol the next day, as Wasps took on holders Toulon, was similar, if not quite as relentlessly raucous. Many Premiership grounds are full, but they lack the constant bedlam to be found in the best Gallic arenas. The Millennium Stadium when a big Test is on takes some beating, while Thomond Park, Limerick, is the spiritual home of supporter fanaticism, closely followed by Ravenhill when Ulster play under lights. Munster's home stadium Thomond Park is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere . But Clermont lead the atmosphere league table. It’s not necessarily a great place to go in support of doomed visitors, but those who haven’t been should try it as neutrals, for a big French Top 14 clash. The place produces an epic occasion founded on fervent civic pride. CORBISIERO'S STRUGGLES RAISE DOUBTS . When certain players go down in pain and require treatment on the field, there is a particular sense of foreboding. Alex Corbisiero is in that category. The Northampton prop didn’t feature for England during the recent Six Nations and was forced off during the Saints’ thumping defeat at Clermont last weekend, apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee – which has been a problem area before. More recently, the Lions loosehead was laid low with a shoulder injury and he could be seen flexing that joint at Stade Marcel Michelin. Corbisiero hasn’t started a Test for England for 28 months. His club insist this latest setback is ‘only a bruise’, but there will be grave doubts about this world-class player’s ability to scale the heights again, until he plays regularly without mishap. Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero has not started a game for England in nearly two years . Saints and England lock Courtney Lawes is a doubt for his side's clash with Exeter on Sunday . Courtney Lawes has what Northampton are calling a ‘bad shoulder’ and may not feature in Sunday’s clash with Exeter. There was better news for Saracens on Thursday, as Jacques Burger will be available for their Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont, after escaping with a one-match ban for striking Maxime Machenaud of Racing Metro. LAST WORD . Now that he has been duly confirmed as one of the 12 referees appointed for the World Cup, Nigel Owens should just go ahead and book his room in the Twickenham area for the final on October 31. The Welshman is close to being a shoo-in for that showpiece occasion, unless his cause is shattered by Warren Gatland’s national team emerging from the ‘Pool of Death’ and going one step further than they did four years ago. It is no coincidence that Owens has presided over many of the greatest encounters at Test and club level in recent years. Nigel Owens (left) is the frontrunner to referee the World Cup final, unless Wales make it there of course . His empathy, style of communication and desire to let the game flow mean he is respected worldwide. He has acquired a high profile, but it does nothing to detract from his professionalism. Happily, this year’s tournament cannot be tarnished by the attention-seeking antics of Alain Rolland and Steve Walsh, who have both retired. Referees are there to monitor, adjudicate and facilitate, not try to up-stage the teams and players.", "summary": "Nick Abendanon was sublime in Clermont's 37-5 win against Northampton .\nAbendanon is ineligible for England because he is playing overseas .\nToulon flanker Steffon Armitage is in the same predicament .\nThe RFU can invoke an 'exceptional' clause to select overseas players .\nBut this clause could create tension in the England camp ."}
{"document": "The parents of a five-year-old transgender boy are sharing their son’s story with the world in a bid to prove that there is no such thing as being ‘too young’ to identify as transgender. Massachusetts couple Mimi and Joe Lemay's son Jacob wasn't always a boy. The five-year-old was born Mia, the second of three sisters. But from a very early age, Jacob began rejecting his gender. And after years of questioning how to handle his preferences, before finally coming to terms with what their son wanted, the Lemays explained to NBC News that they decided to let their child assume the identity of a boy. Scroll down for video. Boys will be boys: Mimi and Joe Lemay's five-year-old son Jacob was born a girl named Mia, but the couple has now accepted that their child is a boy . Mimi and Joe began to notice that Jacob was having difficulties when he was a toddler. Then named Mia, he would insist on changing his clothes 10 to 12 times a day, in an attempt to find something he felt comfortable in, before his parents bought him a blue 'doggy sweater' that he wore for six months straight - often over girlier dresses and tutus. The couple assumed they were just raising a tomboy. 'She would take on \"boy\" personas, and just always want to play with boy things,' said Joe. 'Her need to play boy roles, and her need to be seen or spoken to as a boy at home became very persistent,' added Mimi. Then, shortly before he turned three, Jacob declared himself a boy. Happy family: Jacob was born the second of three daughters in the Massachusetts-based Lemay family . Finding the right wardrobe: From a young age, Jacob (R) preferred to wear boy clothes; when his parents still dressed him as a girl, the frustrated toddler would change outfits up to 12 times a day . Mimi said that she  was worried that Jacob's behavior would make it harder for him to build relationships - already, he had trouble relating to his peers - and she hoped her child's desire to be a boy would go away. In the meantime, she and Joe made allowances while Jacob wasn't in public. Home became a 'battleground over gender', Mimi wrote in a letter to Jacob on his fifth birthday, which was published by The Synapse, continuing that they decided to let Jacob cut his hair, wear boy clothes, and assume aspects of his male identity at home. While this made things easier when just family was around - his older sister eventually stopped teasing him about not being a 'real boy' - things were still hard at school, where Jacob didn't engage with his classmates. Jacob's parents explained that their son's behavior wasn't just that of a typical tomboy. Not content to just 'pretend' to be a boy, Jacob, then still called Mia, hated her body and would say things like: 'Why did god make me this way? Why did god make me wrong?' Trying to fit in: While he was still perceived as a girl, Jacob would only open up around his family and had trouble getting along with his peers . Accepting his identity: The Lemays eased into Jacob's transition, slowly allowing him to wear boy clothes, cut his hair short, and refer to himself as a boy at home . Mimi and Joe saw a glimpse of their future on an April 2014 trip to Disney World. They let Jacob wear a Prince Charming costume, and when strangers called him handsome he 'just glowed'. His mother said persistence, consistence, and insistence are the hallmarks of a possibly transgender child - and Jacob was demonstrating all three. In June 2014, the Lemays sat Jacob down and showed him a video about another transgender boy, Ryland Whittington. Tears in her eyes, Mimi told him: 'All we want is for you to be happy, but we need help to understand what will make you happy.' Joe asked Jacob if he wanted to be like Ryland and have everyone know he's a boy. 'I can't,' Jacob told them. 'I have to be Mia at school.' His parents told him that if he wanted to, he could start attending a new school in the fall. Jacob was elated, telling them, 'I want to be a boy always.' The Lemays began to let Jacob transition. Playing the prince: On a trip to Disney World last year, Jacob (pictured right with his sister Ella) was thrilled when strangers mistook him for a boy in his Prince Charming Costume . Happy kid: Since transitioning, Jacob has come into his own; he socializes and shows affection more since he has started to feel more like himself . Mimi says she and her husband didn't expect the 'seismic shift' in Jacob's behavior and personality that they experienced, but the boy completely came out of his shell. He immediately became more social, more affectionate, and more interested in picking up hobbies. 'He's just a different person. He's becoming himself,' said Joe. Watching how the change has affected Jacob has allowed his parents to see Jacob as he sees himself. 'I realized he had never really been Mia,' Mimi said. 'That had been a figment of my imagination.' The Lemays hope that coming forward to talk about their experience will help Jacob grow up in a society where there's a better perception of transgender people.", "summary": "Mimi and Joe Lemay of Massachusetts say their son Jacob was never happy as a girl, adding that he has called himself a boy since he was two .\nIt took years and many emotional ups and downs before the couple finally decided to let him transition .\nNow attending a school where everyone knows him as a boy, Jacob is the happiest and most outgoing he has ever been ."}

He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle.

{"document": "(CNN)The classic video game \"Space Invaders\" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

The chances of the Uruguayan filling what would appear to be a looming striker void at Old Trafford have always been slim. For a start, at 28 he would appear to be too old for Louis van Gaal, who prefers to work with young talent he can mould into his type of player. Edinson Cavani falls flat on his face during a limp display for PSG against Barcelona on Tuesday night . Manchester United have been linked with Cavani but the striker hasn't impressed this season . Radamel Falcao has struggled at Manchester United after signing on loan from Ligue 1 side Monaco . And the painful, expensive experience of Radamel Falcao's nightmare loan spell will have made the club's Dutch manager wary of seemingly-fading South Americans. But United, who have cash to burn and gaps to fill, will have kept a close eye on Tuesday night's events at the Nou Camp to see if Cavani still had what it takes. On the evidence of a sterile 90 minutes in an inevitable 2-0 defeat he does not. There is mitigation – Barcelona look unstoppable and few in Europe can live with Luis Enrque's resurgent treble hunters. Questions over Cavani's domestic form, however, still linger. France's Ligue 1 is not the Premier League or La Liga and after making the £55m move from Napoli, where he was almost unplayable, Cavani has not been the prolific force officials at Parc des Princes hoped for. This season he has played 32 times in domestic competitions and has scored 11 goals, although six more have come in the Champions League. Louis van Gaal prefers to work with younger players and may have been put off Cavani by Falcao's spell . The Uruguayan hasn't scored as many goals as he should have done in the French league . PSG will now concentrate on winning a two-horse race with Lyon at the top of the table (they are currently level on points with a game in hand) and will look to Cavani along with Zlatan Ibrahimovic to fire them over the line first. Following the 3-1 first leg defeat by Barcelona on home soil the man himself maintained he wants to see out the remainder of his contract in France.

{"document": "Connected: Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi came in contact with Hizb ut-Tahrir while studying at Westminster University . An extremist Islamist group with a 'big UK support base' has joined forces with al-Qaeda in Syria, according to reports. Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) has reportedly attacked civil activists in Aleppo alongside local al-Qaeda franchise Nusra Front, the Times has revealed. Several British men linked to ISIS, including Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi, are known to have been in contact with the group while studying at UK universities. Maajid Nawaz, the Liberal Democrats' Parliamentary candidate which the Daily Mail revealed to have been trying to touch a naked lap dancer at an East London strip club, was a member of HT for 13 years and jailed in Egypt for his commitment to the group. A spokesman for Nawaz said he denied touching the dancer ‘inappropriately’ and that the visit to the strip club was part of his stag night. One week ago, around 100 HT members, one armed with a sword, attacked activists in eastern Aleppo during an anti-regime demonstration, The Times reports. A photograph from the demonstration seen by the newspaper allegedly shows 'HT members confronting activists, while balaclava-wearing fighters from the Nusra Front stand guard'. A spokesperson for Hizb ut-Tahrir in the UK denied any involvement with the Nusra Front and al-Qaeda in Syria. Hizb ut-Tahrir (Arabic for Party of Liberation) is an international Muslim organisation which, like ISIS, advocates a single Islamic state, or caliphate, in the Middle East under Islamic law. The group is banned in many Middle East countries and also in Russia, Turkey, Pakistan and Germany but not in Australia, the US or UK. During his 2010 election campaign, David Cameron promised to ban the group, whose UK branch was founded in 1986, but the organisation is still alive and well in Britain. Hizb ut-Tahrir has been known to recruit members at British universities and evidence emerged earlier this year showing the group may have been involved in the radicalisation of ISIS executioner Mohammad Emwazi. Londoner Emwazi, known before his unmasking as 'Jihadi John', is said to have taken part in events at Westminster University where members of HT were among the speakers. Scroll down for video . Converted: Lib Dem candidate Maajid Nawaz, pictured with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, spent 13 years inside Hizb ut-Tahrir and was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group .

Recruiting ground: Several men linked to ISIS are known to have been in contact with Hizb ut-Tahrir while studying at British universities . Four years ago, a student connected to HT was elected president of the Students’ Union at the central London university. His vice-president also had links to the group, which raised concerns that the union had been taken over by extremists. Waheed Ahmed, 21 – the son of Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed who was arrested in Turkey last month trying to cross into Syria with eight other Brits - is said to be a member after being recruited as a student at Manchester University. Lib Dem candidate Nawaz, prospective MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, spent 13 years inside Hizb ut-Tahrir and was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group. On his return to England in 2006, the 37-year-old renounced his views and set up 'counter-extremism think-tank' the Quilliam Foundation. This follows revelations by the Daily Mail this morning that the would-be MP was filmed trying to touch an exotic dancer during several private sessions at a strip club in Whitechapel, east London. Despite his prominent position in the local Muslim community, Nawaz - a married father-of-one - visited the 'gentlemen's club' during the holy month of Ramadan, the owner says.

{"document": "Yaya Toure's attacking gifts aren't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore, said Gary Neville in a scathing attack on the Ivorian following Manchester City's 4-2 derby loss to United. Manuel Pellegrini's City were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against Louis van Gaal's side at Old Trafford and Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, is certain big changes are afoot for the club. 'It's a crossroads for them now,' Neville said as City drifted four points behind their third-placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off Arsenal in second. Yaya Toure's defensive lapses are costing Manchester City, claims Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under-fire Ivorian . 'There is definitely going to be change at Manchester City, whether it's players, the manager, people above. Certainly some players. 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick. You cannot carry passengers.' Neville singled out Toure as an example of the 'weeds' at the Etihad in a scathing attack. 'He does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively,' he said. 'But when the balance tips to a point when going forward isn't quite as effective as it once was, you've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor. Neville predicts changes at Manchester City and says the club need to get rid of 'weeds in the garden' 'If I was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you're not chasing back, you're not running around, you're not sprinting for the ball. There might be a physical problem that he cannot do it, let alone if he doesn't want to do it. I think there's definitely going to be some changes.' Graeme Souness, also on Sky Sports, even suggested the 31-year-old's work when his side doesn't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing Champions League results in recent years. Neville accused Toure of a 'complete dereliction of (his) duty' when marking Marouane Fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for United's third goal from Juan Mata. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday their their cross-city rivals . 'He cannot play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality,' said Neville on Sky Sports. 'Against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top, but against any team of quality you've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield. 'There are too many examples, too much evidence when watching him where he cannot do his job, simple as that. As a central midfield player in the big matches he just cannot do it.' Souness said Toure's become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate after the winger's cross found the tall Belgian for 2-1 . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why they've not done as well as they should have done in Europe.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pointed the finger at the City chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are 'gone'. The former Liverpool defender told talkSPORT: 'They’ve been a great team, but that team needs breaking up and changing. The criticism I have is for the people at the top, to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team. 'You look at the age of the team and it’s too old, so you need a lot of new blood. It’s going to take a lot of money. 'It’s gone for them now, physically, mentally, every part of the game. They’ve been a great team and we should applaud what they’ve achieved over the past three or four years, but it’s the end for this team now. It’s got to be broken up.' Niall Quinn, also on Sky Sports, said bluntly: 'Manchester City lost out today because he was all at sea and didn't do his defensive duties.' Toure also came in for criticism on Match of the Day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain's armband at half-time. Trevor Sinclair said: 'He keeps on getting caught in no-mans land, he's not really at it, clipping the heels, and he's literally going through the motions. Trevor Sinclair and Phil Neville were both critical of City and Toure on Match of the Day 2 . 'Fellaini has completely outshone him today. He is outnumbered and I'm sure he's frustrated but again he's just going through the motions.' Picking out on particular aerial duel, which Toure lost, Sinclair said: 'This is nothing to do with ability, that's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team.' Sinclair also felt Toure was at fault for Chris Smalling's goal, United's fourth. 'He's got to organise this better,' he said. 'If you're captain of the team you've got to keep that high line, dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball. They were queuing up on the far stick.' Phil Neville said: 'The minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall, they crumble. They lost their shape, they lost their discipline, they were all over the place. 'There was nobody in there today that said \"right, we're going to get two banks of four, hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result\".'", "summary": "Manchester City lost 4-2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .\nYaya Toure was the subject of scathing criticism on Sky Sports .\nGary Neville said Toure cannot handle central midfield against 'quality'\nNeville used Ivorian as an example of 'weeds in the garden' at City ."}

{"document": "The belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed. David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs – which include Prozac and Seroxat – was based on the ‘marketing of a myth’. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, ‘a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance’. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: ‘For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. ‘For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.’ However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor’s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established. How they do this is not. ‘Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. ‘Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. ‘People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.’ NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: ‘It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.’ Professor Healy’s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: ‘In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year’s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday’s models. ‘The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin’, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King’s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn’t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs ‘correct’ an ‘imbalance’ of serotonin in the brain. ‘Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’ ‘Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin’s involvement in depression.’ Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: ‘In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. ‘David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. ‘In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. ‘The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.’", "summary": "David Healy is head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatry unit in Bangor .\nClaims the idea low levels of serotonin causes depression is a fallacy .\nMarketing of SSRI drugs like Prozac has been 'based on a myth', he claims .\nExperts refute his claims saying 'SSRIs work in the real world of the clinic'"}

{"document": "The suicides of five young sailors who served on the same base over two years has unearthed a shocking culture of ice taking, binge drinking, bullying and depression within the Australian Navy. The sailors were stationed or had been stationed at the West Australian port of HMAS Stirling off the coast of Rockingham, south of Perth. Their families did not learn of their previous attempts to take their own lives and their drug use until after their deaths, according to ABC's 7.30 program. Scroll down for video . Stuart Addison was serving on HMAS Stirling off the coast of Western Australia when he took his own life . Five of the sailors who committed suicide had been serving with the Australian Navy on HMAS Stirling . Stuart Addison hanged himself while he was on-shore leave in 2011 and his father, Mark Addison, was faced with the tough decision to turn off his son's life support after several days in hospital. 'It's a decision that I don't think... any parent should have to make,' Mark told 7.30. Mark was left devastated by his loss and was dealt a further blow when navy records revealed his son had tired to take his own life twice before. Stuart had also been on psychiatric medication, which the family were also unaware about. His father, Mark Addison, was devastated by the blow and had to make the difficult decision to turn his son's life support . Matt Henry, who was friends with Stuart, said there was a drug culture within the Australian Navy . 'They knew and we weren't told about it. We were kept in the dark,' Stuart's sister Jessica Ames said. To make sure this does not happen to other families, Mark has started up a change.org petition asking Prime Minister Tony Abbott to allow the families of military personnel access to their files when there was evidence of self-harm. Brett Dwyer, who was best friends with Stuart, took his own life just months later . He wants to make sure the devastating pain he feels never happens to other families. It was also revealed by Stuart's friend and former sailor Matt Henry, who had also attempted to take his own life on several occasions, that ice use and drinking was rife within the ranks of HMAS Sterling. Mr Henry said ice was the 'drug of choice in Western Australia' because it was so readily available through their sailor friends. He said he believed his friends' use of the drug ruined their lives. Another sailor, Brett Dwyer, who served alongside Stuart took his own life just three months after his best friend. Brett's doctors advised the navy he should not have been sent to sea due to chemical burns on his hands. But he was sent to HMAS Stirling where he was bullied by Navy personnel. His RSL counsellor, Brian O'Neill, said one 'disgusting' incident involved Brett being dangled overboard by his legs by shipmates. In late 2011, Brett was discharged after saying he had used drugs, including ice. Mr O'Neill said the young sailor was not taking the illicit substance and just said he did to break free of the navy. 'We woke up in the morning and he was hanging on our balustrade which is in the middle of the house. His mother and I had to cut him down,' Brett's father, Mark Dwyer, told the national broadcaster. Like the Addisons, Brett's family did not find out about his medical history until after his death. Brett was on psychiatric medication to treat his depression. Stuart's family did not know he was on psychiatric medication and sister Jessica Ames said they were kept in the dark by the navy . RSL counsellor Brian O'Neill said Mr Dwyer told the navy he was taking ice to get out of the service . 'I wouldn't wish that on any family. What they did was wrong,' Mark said. 'They think of him as a number. He wasn’t a number, he was our son.' Three more similar cases of men who took their own lives were revealed in the 7.30 report. Their mental health issues and suicide attempts were kept inside the Navy and their families only became aware after their funerals. This included Jake Casey, Ewen McDonald and Stephen Bebbington. Both Jake Casey (left), who was pallbearer for Brett Dwyer, and Stephen Bebbington (right) took their own lives . 'They're trying to sweep this issue under the carpet,' Ewen's sister Kenna Crichton said. He tried to take his own three times before he shot himself in October 2011, following the death of best friend Stephen who committed suicide six months earlier. While Jake Casey, who was pallbearer for Brett Dwyer, developed an ice habit and hanged himself three days before the first anniversary of his friend's death. He had ice in system when he was found. But one navy wife tried to warn the service about the problem when she found out her husband had a drug habit. The wife of Bradley Livingston said he had a drug problem and took ice, which she tried to warn his commanding officer about . Karley Livingston said her claims were ignored and she was treated by the officer as a 'stupid navy wife' Mr Livingston died of a suspected drug overdose, but it is not clear if he wanted to take his own life . Karley Livingston's husband, Bradley Livingston, died of a suspected drug overdose and had tried to prevent this from happening by going to his commanding officer. She was told by the officer to go to the chaplain and was treated like a 'stupid navy wife'. The Navy said it was now investigating Ms Livingston's claim. The service has reviewed its privacy policy about suicide attempts and will not be making changes, 7.30 reported. 'Defence conducted a review of Health Information Practices in late 2013,' the navy said in a statement. 'The review reaffirmed that it is the member who determines who has access to their personal health information and recommended that there be no change to defence policy or practice in third party disclosure.'", "summary": "Five sailors took their own lives while serving on WA's HMAS Stirling .\nSuicides happened over two years and some had attempted it before .\nStuart Addison's family didn't know about his other attempts until his death .\nIt was a similar case for four other families, including Stuart's close friends .\nRevelations of ice use, binge drinking and depression have also emerged ."}

Wolfsburg came into the clash having lost just once in their last 26 matches in all competitions, a run that included two victories against Italian opposition Inter Milan in the previous round. And the Germans started the game brightly as they looked to impose their slick passing game on Napoli, but it was the visitors who opened the scoring. Dries Mertens checked back on to his right foot from wide on the left and delivered an inch-perfect ball over the top for Higuain, who was just onside. The Argentine striker brought the ball under control with what looked like a combination of chest and upper arm before firing past Diego Benaglio with the outside of his right foot - his seventh of the competition. The Wolfsburg defenders were rightly aggrieved but their protestations fell on deaf ears as the referee waved away their handball appeals. They could have no complaints seven minutes later, however, as Hamsik broke clear of the Wolves' backline to apply a composed finish to a slick, flowing move that ended with Higuain's defence-splitting pass. Gonzalo Higuain gave Napoli the lead with a smart finish via the outside his foot after 15 minutes . Slovakian Hamsik doubled the Italians lead midway through the first half to put them firmly in control . The Napoli captain celebrates in front of the travelling supporters after finishing off a fine move . Wolfsburg almost halved the deficit on the stroke of half-time. Former Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle cut in from the left and struck a rasping drive that needed every inch of Mariano Andujar's frame to tip the effort onto the crossbar. Some sloppy Wolfsburg play  allowed Hamsik to grab his second on 64 minutes as the tie slipped away from Dieter Hecking's side. Benaglio played the ball out to Josuha Guilavogui, who turned and passed the ball straight to Jose Callejon.

{"document": "The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Promise: David Cameron and the Conservatives plan to extend ‘right to buy’ from council houses to housing association properties if they win . Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. ' So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’", "summary": "Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, is a critic of Tory plan .\nShe  bought Islington house for £440,000 in 2005, now worth £1million .\nAnti-right to buy Ms Davison, is also a member of her local Labour party ."}

The unusual fundraising is part of a desperate bid to raise money for his nine-year-old son Chen Minghao, who is suffering from leukaemia. Desperate father Chen Yuntao, 38, has started dressing as a horse and begging people to ride him in exchange for 54p. He is frantically trying to raise money for his son's ever-growing medical bills for his cancer treatment . Mr Chen kneels on the ground as he begs and has a sign, explaining his plight. The family are already in huge debt after son Minghao underwent 20 course of chemotherapy for leukaemia, and now the cancer has returned . The family is 160,000 yuan (£17,500) in debt for treatment he has already received, having already spent 200,000 yuan (£21,800) on medical bills, The People's Daily Online reports. The next course of therapy will cost between 400,000 and 500,000 yuan (£43,600 to £54,600). After Mr Chen first starting begging at the entrance of a subway the city management turned up within minutes to move him along – but when they learnt about his heart-breaking situation, they offered to help find him a better spot. 'I saw others raising funds in the street using a sign so I gave it a try', the 38-year-old said. 'If it wasn't the very last resort I would never have thought I would be begging on the street. 'Yesterday my son just completed the current stage of his chemotherapy and the doctors say that as soon as the boy is physically ready he can proceed to the next stage of treatment which I have no money for.' 'In the village I saw children paying to ride on horses so I thought I could pretend to be a horse and offer rides to raise money for my son. For my son I will gladly do anything.' Little Minghao, nine, has been in and out of hospital for treatment since 2011. His father said begging on the street while dressed as a horse was a 'last resort', but he would 'gladly do anything' for his child . As yet nobody has taken the opportunity to ride Mr Chen, but plenty of kind-hearted strangers have donated money. He came up with the idea of dressing up as a horse after watching children pay to be taken on a ride . Minghao was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in December 2011. After 20 courses of chemotherapy he was finally able to leave hospital in 2013 – but during a routine check-up in March the family was told his cancer had returned. As yet no-one has ridden Mr Chen, but many passers-by have donated money to him. Dr Xu, who is looking after Minghao, said in all the years the family had been in hospital he had never seen the father wear new clothes or bring the child in food. 'I know they are very poor but I didn't know that they were in such poverty', he said. Doctors of Minghao, pictured in his hospital bed, said they didn't realise the family was so desperately poor. The next course of his cancer treatment will cost up to 500,000 Yuan, but the family is entitled to some relief . 'To know Mr Chen is begging on the street in order to raise funds for his child is really sad and upsetting.' Nine-year-old Minghao said: 'The needles are not painful anymore. I hope to recover soon so that I can go back to school.' The family will qualify for seriously illness release on the next course of treatment, meaning they will have a 90 per cent reimbursement. However, Mr Chen will still need to find another 50,000 Yuan (£5,500) plus ongoing post-treatment medical expenses if Minghao begins to recover.", "summary": "Desperate father is begging people to ride him to raise much-needed cash .\nFamily is in thousands of pounds of debt from numerous rounds of chemo .\nLittle Minghao, 9, needs further treatment after leukaemia came back ."}
{"document": "Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the United States. The new policy allows for an American traveler who has been denied boarding a commercial airliner to petition the U.S. Transportation Security Administration once to find out whether he or she is on the no-fly list and a second time for an unclassified explanation of why he or she is on the list. In some cases, the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns. The changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government's counterterrorism efforts since the September 2001 terror attacks. Grounded or not grounded? Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October . But the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it. The explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said. For instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse. 'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi. The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.' Last fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size. Previously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. In most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights. Travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. The TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron. In 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list. The government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. The letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said. 'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said. The TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years. 'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said.", "summary": "Previously, the U.S. did not disclose whether a stopped traveler was on the list or why .\nBut facing legal pressure from the ACLU, the Obama administration has enacted a new policy to let Americans know if they are on the list .\nGrounded Americans are also now allowed to inquire about how they got on the list .\nHowever, the government has not promised to reveal why in all cases - citing possible national security threats .\nLast fall there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, and Americans made up approximately 5 per cent ."}

{"document": "We spent £400 on a 1940s loo - it took us four months to find one! Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there’s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we’d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I’ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we’re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn’t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost £400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country — the most we’ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year’s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for £200. They said: 'We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around £45,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It’s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we’re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: ‘Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?’ We’re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost £200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I’ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s — they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there’s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we’ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn’t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it’s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it’s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about £10,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I’ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for £100 each. But it’s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for £40 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves — they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can’t help but buy it — at one point I owned six. I’ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between £100 and £200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn’t want my house to look like everyone else’s — that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum’s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick — Andy Warhol’s muse — I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about £20 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at £100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost £5 from a charity shop — I don’t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don’t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I’ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn’t fit in my kitchen so I’ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that’s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits.

{"document": "It could have easily been passed off as an April Fool's Day joke, but for one couple winning the £53million EuroMillions jackpot was a reality. Richard and Angela Maxwell, from Coningsby in Lincolnshire, became 10th on the National Lottery rich list after they scooped £53,193,914 on the  draw on Tuesday. The couple, both 67, so far have only modest plans for what to do with the huge windfall - with Mr Maxwell planning to retire and play bowls. Scroll down for video . Richard and Angela Maxwell from Lincolnshire have become the 10th biggest British winners of Euromillions . Mrs Maxwell said she thought her husband was playing an April Fools' Day joke on her when he told her . The semi-retired consultant in the poultry industry said: 'I always keep our lottery tickets in the kitchen drawer so I took a break and went online to check the results. 'I looked first at the two Lucky Stars and noticed we had those. Then I scanned across to the first main number and immediately knew they all matched our numbers. I checked again and again, five times in total, as I couldn't believe it.' Mr Maxwell said he was in shock when he saw only one ticket had won £53million and believed someone had scanned his ticket and put it on the website as a joke. 'It was April Fool's Day after all,' he added. The father-of-two kept the win to himself for four more hours until wife Angela got home from helping to cook for a local OAP luncheon club. He said: 'I knew Angela would be busy and wouldn't answer her mobile phone so I waited til she got home. 'I kept myself busy making cups of tea for the builders because I couldn't sit still but didn't say anything to anyone.' When his wife came back carrying a basket of tea towels and asking about dinner plans, Mr Maxwell said: 'Angela, I've got something to tell you.' The shocked couple plan to take their family on holiday to New Zealand first class and buy a Land Rover . His wife said: 'I didn't know what to think. Richard just went red in the face and then said \"we've won £53 million\". 'I just said \"don't be stupid\" - he's always playing jokes so I thought it was an April's Fool. 'I just didn't believe it, then he showed me the numbers on the website and I dropped the basket of tea towels on the floor. I then just sat down in the chair for about half-an-hour stunned.' When the couple called their two daughters, Sharon, 45, and Paula, 44, they too thought it was an April Fool's joke. The couple are still thinking about what to do with the huge windfall but have already decided to upgrade a planned holiday to New Zealand - by taking the whole family first-class. They said they are also keen to help good causes and will donate some of the cash to their local community . Sports fan Mr Maxwell said he will now be able to retire completely to enjoy following Boston United and big sporting events, and play golf and bowls. Mr Maxwell is also going to treat himself to a Land Rover, while his wife plans to splash out on designer handbags and shoes. Mrs Maxwell said: 'Richard says he wants to travel round the world watching sport. I can go with him but I don't think I'll be watching any sport. It'll be retail therapy for me. 'As soon as we told the girls it started to dawn on us just how big an amount of money it is. 'It still hasn't sunk in. We don't know if we will make anyone millionaires but we will make sure our family is OK.' Mr Maxwell added: 'It's a life-changing amount of money - £1 million would have been amazing but £53 million enables you to do so much, not just for you, but those around you. 'Our local community is really important to us, in particular helping young people in the area. The win will enable us to spend more time getting involved, as well as give financial support.' Mr Maxwell said he survived prostate cancer eight years ago and is now in remission . He said: 'I had three operations and it was successful in the end. I was very ill for quite a while. That's why I retired from full-time work. He added: 'It made me realise that every day is a gift. We are not materialistic people. We don't crave things. 'We are simple people. Winning this amount of money would change anyone but we are going to try and stay grounded and live the way we've always done.' Mr Maxwell said his experience had inspired some of his fundraising and added that his motorcycling group has raised £50,000 for Macmillan nurses in the last three years. With their money they could buy 450 semi-detached houses in Lincolnshire or eight million tonnes of the county's famous sausages. The winning balls were 8, 20, 24, 28, 49 with lucky stars of 8 and 9. It comes in the same week that another couple - from neighbouring North Lincolnshire - beat odds of 283 billion to one to win £1 million in the EuroMillions lottery for a second time.

Mr Long said yesterday he 'just knew it would be my turn again some day' as the couple become the first people to win £1 million twice who have gone public. And the former lorry driver has not ruled out winning for a third time despite being perplexed at being labelled the luckiest man in Britain. The couple previously banked £1,000,000 in the EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle draw on Friday July 26, 2013, before they married. Despite their windfall, they decided to upgrade their prefabricated home - adding a conservatory and other improvements - rather than spend their cash on an upmarket house. Now they are looking for what they called today their 'dream home', although they still appeared to be thinking about a modest semi. The record for the biggest ever National Lottery win is held by husband and wife Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire. They said they had been 'tickled pink' after claiming £161,653,000 in July 2011 to rank among Europe's biggest lottery winners. Psychiatric nurse Mrs Weir and Mr Weir, who worked as a TV cameraman and studio manager for 23 years, reportedly bought a fleet of cars for friends since their win as well as a mansion with their EuroMillions winnings. They are followed on the rich list by Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Haverhill, Suffolk, who won £148,656,000 in August 2012, and an anonymous ticket-holder who scooped £113,019,926 in October 2010.

{"document": "(CNN)Debates on climate change can break down fairly fast. There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. \"I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,\" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,\" Obama said. \"You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better.\" \"There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,\" Obama continued. \"Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate.\" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. \"It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,\" Murthy said.  \"Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse.\" \"This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. \"The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,\" Obama told Gupta. \"What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis.\" \"Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,\" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \"These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,\" the EPA says on its website. \"Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change.\" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. \"Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition.\" \"Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,\" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. \"We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health.\" \"Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?\" \"Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,\" writes Neira. \"Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider.\" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. \"Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,\" the agency warns. \"Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves.\" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. \"Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,\" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. \"Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,\" the article says. \"This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough.\" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. \"When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,\" Obama said. \"The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog.\" \"We know how to do this,\" Obama said. \"We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.\"", "summary": "President Obama attends Howard University roundtable on climate change and public health .\nLinking climate change to how it affects a person's health is a new way to talk about the subject ."}

Hazard scored a penalty and set up Loic Remy's winner - either side of Charlie Adam's 65-yard strike - in Saturday's 2-1 win over Stoke which saw the Blues take a seven-point lead at the top of the standings. Jose Mourinho has targeted five wins and one draw in the remaining eight games and Hazard is optimistic Chelsea will win a first Premier League title in five years. Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard insists his side are close to getting their hands on the Premier League title . Hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard-fought win over Stoke City in west London . Hazard told Chelsea TV: 'We are confident. We are first in the league and we take game after game. We have the title in our hands. We want to bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge.' Hazard felt Chelsea's win could have been more convincing. 'In the first half we created a lot of chances,' he added. 'We played beautiful football and OK, we scored just one goal, but we deserved to score three or four. The Belgian international gave Chelsea the lead from the spot and made no mistake against Asmir Begovic . 'The most important thing was the victory and we did very well till the end.' Remy's strike came after Diego Costa had come on as a half-time substitute before going off with a recurrence of his hamstring problem 11 minutes later. Hazard has backed Remy, who could be given an extended run in Costa's anticipated absence, to keep on scoring after the France striker's second winner in successive games. 'He can score every time when he's on the pitch. This guy deserves to score a lot of goals,' Hazard said. Loic Remy finishes to put Chelsea back in front after a mistake by Stoke City keeper Begovic . The Belgium playmaker dazzled at times against Stoke, but the game's highlight was Adam's audacious lob of Thibaut Courtois from well inside his own half. Chelsea felt aggrieved Hazard had not been awarded a foul before Adam drilled the ball into the home net. In hindsight, and with victory secured, Hazard joked he was happy referee Jonathan Moss had not blown his whistle as, had a foul been given, Adam's goal would never have happened.

{"document": "Hundreds of seals are being killed in British waters in order to protect stocks of salmon and other fish which are destined for supermarket shelves. The seal cull even takes place during the animals' breeding season - meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead. Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England, but campaigners insist there are more humane methods of protecting fish. Warning: graphic images . Killed: This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie, north-east Scotland in an attempt to protect fish stocks . Shot: A seal killed near Blackpool; it is legal to cull seals without a licence in England . The practice of seal clubbing in Canada has long been regarded with revulsion around the world - but many Britons may be unaware that the animals are also being killed in the UK. Supporters of the practice claim that seals threaten farmed salmon, wild fish around the coasts and fish which are kept for sporting purposes. Figures from the Scottish government show that 205 seals were legally killed in Scottish waters last year by farmers, fishermen and angling firms. Some campaigners suggest that the real number of dead seals is much higher, as the official figure only includes those which were recorded to the authorities by people who had previously obtained licences. Fishermen have been given licences to kill more than 800 seals this year, although typically marksmen kill only around a quarter of the seals which can legally be culled. Trussed up: Two dead seals which have been thrown in the back of a van after being culled . Disposal: A van winches away the body of a seal after it was shot dead in Crovie to protect fish . Marksman: A gunman waits for the appearance of seals which could threaten stocks of salmon . Activists have called on consumers to more careful about buying Scottish salmon in supermarkets and fishmongers, encouraging them to investigate the origins of their fish. 'People who are horrified by what's happening in places like Norway and Scotland don't realise this is happening on their own doorstep,' said Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. 'The shooting tends to go on in remote locations, so it's not something most people tend to come across. Unlike in some countries, seals are not hunted in the UK for their skin, fur or meat. However, fishermen and farmer are allowed to kill seals which they believe are threatening fish stocks. In Scotland, they must get a licence which restricts the number of animals they can legally kill. But in the rest of Britain, there are no legal restrictions on culling seals, meaning people are free to do as they please. 'It's very simple - ask your retailer before you buy Scottish salmon whether seals were shot in the production of that salmon. 'Not every fish farmer is shooting seals, it's perfectly possible to protect fish without shooting seals.' He insisted that there is no need to cull seals in order to keep them away from fish stocks, saying that acoustic deterrents and strong nets can protect salmon just as well. Around three quarters of farms where seals are killed are certified by the RSPCA as 'Freedom Food' farms, Mr Ottaway added, saying that the animal protection charity should do more to crack down on the practice. He also called on the Scottish government to toughen up its licensing regime, which states that seals should only be killed as a 'last resort'. Mr Ottaway said: 'It's not the last resort if they're not using the best possible deterrents and the best possible nets. 'They recognise the value of seals as a tourist attraction, but have no problem with shooting them.' Threatened: British seal pups could starve if their mothers are shot dead (file photo) Protection: You need a licence to kill seals in Scotland but not in other parts of the UK (file photo) Because there are no restrictions on when farmers can kill seals if they have a licence, breeding mothers are likely to die, leaving their cubs unable to fend for themselves. Outside Scotland, it is legal to kill seals without any need for a licence - meaning that there is no way of measuring exactly how many die every year. The Scottish salmon industry, which produces annual export of £285million, insists that it is necessary to kill seals in order to protect farms. Scott Landsburgh of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation told the Daily Mirror: 'We have championed deterrence techniques that are designed to keep seals away from our fish, and shooting is always last resort. 'When a determined seal attacks fish in our pens it can kill and damage large numbers and it is important that we do whatever we can to reduce the chances of this happening.' A spokesman for the Scottish government said: 'Scottish seals are now better protected than ever before. Since 2011 it has been illegal in Scotland to shoot a seal except as a last resort under strict licensing conditions, and the number of seals shot under licence has more than halved since then.'", "summary": "More than 200 seals were legally killed off the Scottish coast last year .\nFishermen and farmers insist the animals are destroying salmon stocks .\nBut campaigners have called for a more humane method of keeping seal away from farmed fish .\nActivists say consumers should put pressure on supermarkets and fishmongers when they are buying Scottish salmon ."}
{"document": "The body of a missing University of Minnesota student has been pulled from the Mississippi River five days after she plunged from a bridge during a night out, medical examiners have said. Jennifer Houle, 22, vanished from a bar in Minneapolis in the early hours of Friday and was later captured on surveillance footage as she walked alone on the 10th Avenue Bridge. Authorities have not said whether she fell or jumped from the bridge, which is 110ft above the river. Following days of searches, a body was recovered on Wednesday. The medical examiner's office identified the body as Houle's on Thursday. Loss: A body believed to belong to Jennifer Houle (pictured left, and left with a friend) has been found in the Mississippi River in Minneapolis after she was last seen on a nearby bridge early on Friday morning . She died of freshwater drowning the medical examiner's office said in a press release, according to the Star Tribune. 'We want to thank law enforcement, all the Hennepin County sheriff's [deputies], the Minneapolis police ... and all the compassion they've shown to us,' John Houle told the Star Tribune. 'They've done such an amazing job keeping us informed about the investigation. We sincerely appreciate their tireless efforts to figure out what happened to Jennifer and to bring her home to us.' Houle was last seen inside a Dinkytown bar, Blarney Pub and Grill, between 1am and 2am on Friday, police said. Her friend Brooke Laven told KSTP that they had gone bar-hopping on Thursday evening but that while they were out, they ran into one of Houle's ex-boyfriends. Discovery: Teams of rescuers are pictured on Monday as they searched the Mississippi River in an effort to recover Houle's body. It was found on Wednesday - five days after she vanished . Last seen: Police said video evidence showed she entered the Mississippi River from this bridge on 10th Avenue, which is just several blocks from the bar. It is not yet clear whether she fell or jumped . 'That kind of set off some emotions,' Laven told KSTP. She said she had become separated from Houle in the bar and was unable to find her. Laven said that Houle's purse and phone were found in the street near her apartment just a few blocks from the bar at 3am on Friday, suggesting she had tried to walk home. But police told DailyMail.com that they believe she had already entered the water by the time the purse was found. 'We extend our deepest condolences to the Houle family and all of Jennifer's many friends,' the police said in a statement. Houle studied management at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and was a Phi Beta Phi sorority member and part of the Women in Business group on campus. On Tuesday evening, more than a thousand friends and well-wishers - many dressed in purple, Houle's favorite color - paid tribute to the student at a vigil at the University of Minnesota.

{"document": "Seoul (CNN)In the first few days after the Sewol disappeared beneath the Yellow Sea, divers pulled body after body from the watery wreckage, bringing the dead home. And throughout the following days, weeks and months, Park Eun-mi waited to see if one of them was her 16-year-old daughter, Huh Da-yun. The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor. The Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to Jeju island, off South Korea's southern coast. \"We kept waiting with belief in finding our daughter. I thought once, 'Somebody will be the last person and what if it's Da-yun?'\" Park said. A year later, Park's life remains at a standstill. Nine have yet to be found. \"We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014,\" said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment. \"I cannot think about anything except to find my daughter and other missing people.\" Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank. Dozens associated with the ferry disaster have been sent to jail on criminal charges. But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved. On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn. Passengers were told repeatedly by the crew members to stay where they were as rescuers would arrive soon. Many of them listened to the instructions and remained in place. As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out. Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel. Divers had to pluck the bodies from the water one-by-one, bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut-wrenching cries of their families. On Thursday, the one year anniversary of the disaster, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye called for the salvage of the Sewol's wreck \"as soon as possible.\" \"Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry. I believe that it is now time to earnestly prepare to salvage,\" she said. A government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing. The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. The agency anticipates a complicated technical operation to remove the ferry, which would weigh about 10,200 tons above water. The process could take over a year and a half, and that it would cost the South Korean government anywhere from $91 million to $182 million. The victims' families have demanded that the ship be recovered in order to thoroughly investigate the accident. Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response. Communication over the rescue efforts were jumbled, paving way for rumors and hoaxes. Criticism swirled over the South Korean Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation. The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports. The recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the Sewol died in May, and in July, five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed. Park, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong. That promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation. Earlier this month, several dozens of family members marched to Seoul from Ansan, the suburb where most of the students had resided. Some of the families shaved their heads to demand political action. Several laws have been passed to inspect cargo weight and increase oversight in the industry. In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity. Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance. An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster. The sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken. \"The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes,\" Park said on Thursday. \"Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously.\" In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates. Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws. In July, the body of a billionaire Yoo Byung Eun, who was believed to have connections to the company that owned the ferry, was found decomposing in a plum field. But some families say that wider, systematic problems that allowed the disaster to occur haven't been addressed.  Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.

{"document": "Attorneys representing more than 8,000 women who were secretly recorded during pelvic exams by a gynecologist at Johns Hopkins will receive $32 million in legal fees from a $190million settlement. The sum, will be divided among patients of Dr. Nikita Levy, a gynecologist who secretly filmed and photographed thousands of women during gynecological exams at a Hopkins-affiliated clinic. The attorneys had originally asked for a 35 percent settlement fee, however the ruling by a Baltimore judge means they will only receive 17.25 per cent. Dr. Nikita Levy was fired from John Hopkins Health System in February 2013 after it was discovered he had surreptitiously videotaped and photographed thousands of women during gynecological exams .

Jonathan Schochor, the suit's lead attorney, says he and the other attorneys won't challenge the judge's order. Dr. Levy was fired in February 2013, days after a co-worker alerted hospital authorities about her suspicions and he was forced to turn over the camera. He committed suicide ten days later. Investigators discovered roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on a series of servers in his home. The settlement is one of the largest settlements on record in the U.S. involving sexual misconduct by a physician, and all but closes a case that never produced criminal charges but threatened the reputation of one of the world's leading medical institutions.

{"document": "Perched on the rooftops of tall buildings in cities across the world, a French photographer has captured the essence of what people do when they're alone, in places where they're surrounded by millions of other people. In her photography project, Inside Views, Floriane de Lassee spots movement in the standstill of the night - she finds lone beating hearts who still have the light on when everyone else is sleeping. 'No matter whether it’s Paris or Istanbul. I do not photograph cities, but an imaginary City that inhabits each megalopolis. It is the product of the Man’s excesses, his genius, his madness. The City exceeds the overflow. She is about to devour us,' de Lassee says about her project. Scroll down for video . From one window into another, French photographer Floriane de Lassee captures a photograph of a man practicing his piano in his London flat . A woman looks on at the vast skyline ahead of her as she stands on a balcony. With a light illuminating her from the front, she appears to radiate in the darkness of the run-down building beside her . In some of her photos, including this one, de Lassee gets close enough to her subjects that she can capture their facial expressions as well as the vast metropolises behind them . In was appears to be an empty building in Tokyo, a person gazes out the window into the night. There isn't a person or car in sight in the illuminated city . In this photo, taken in an unknown city, de Lassee snaps a photo of a person looking to the skyline as she appears to be on the same roof . De Lassee has been photographing the cities of insomnia for at least ten years, and she had a book published filled with pictures of the cities that never sleep in 2008. The French photographer found her inspiration when she studied at the International Center of Photography in New York, according to Les Photographes. Her East Village apartment faced a police station's 'recreation room', where officers, still in uniform, would play table tennis. She found the angle at which she could watch them to be one that should be photographed. 'I'm just trying to move me, to move others, to bring them further in their dreams or in the perception of the world around them. The city that I show is both terrifying and touching. It is this balance that interests me,' she told Les Photographes. A woman in Shanghai stands on her lighted balcony and stares at the massive buildings across the water. Shanghai has a population of more than 14million people . A person looks down from their balcony in what appears to be a private moment, but look above two floors and a neighbor close by still has his or her lights on, too . Two people have a conversation in a room high above the motorway, which is till filled with cars flowing in all directions driving through the darkness . Lights show that this building is home to many different things. The top floor appears to be filled with woman practicing their pole dancing techniques, while floors below show a boardroom and what looks like a high-top table . A woman in an unknown city looks out her floor-to-ceiling window into the city and trees below her high-rise apartment building . Her images show the moment vast cityscapes collide with sole protagonists, resting on balconies, doing work in offices and gazing out windows into the distance. Some pictures show truly how small one person can be compared to the sweeping cities surrounding him or her. De Lassee's goal, however, is not to capture a particular city. She instead tries to find the common traits and emotions that the cities' inhabitants share, according to Vanilla Magazine. The scenes in which her metropolis photos are set are found across the world, including Las Vegas, New York, Moscow, Paris, Istanbul, Shanghai and Tokyo. A woman in Istanbul lies down on her small bed in her flat that sits just in front of the massive and beautiful St. Sophia Mosque . De Lassee's photos can open small windows into people's lives. Her artwork can make a viewer wonder why this man is still up while others are sleeping and why he has such a variety of objects filling his living space . All of the lights are still on in this top-floor apartment. A person sits in front of a bookshelf in the fourth window from the right, while it appears as though no one else is home .

Set in 200 acres of land near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, the Chyknell Hall Estate also boasts a swimming pool, tennis court, stables - and even its own cricket green. Its centrepiece, the 11-bedroom Chyknell Hall, was built in 1814 and has only changed hands twice since.

The owner will also be set up for entertaining with a wine cellar, four-oven Aga, loggia, library and billiard room. And a number of compartment gardens means guests will never be bored by the same view. The estate, described as the 'pinnicle of the residential tree', offers 57 acres of woodland and more than 500 acres of adjoining sporting rights, including game shooting. The land also planning permission for five more properties, should the new owner wish to expand. The ownership of Chyknell Hall Estate can be traced back to medieval times and this is only the third time in its history it has been on the market. It remained in the same family for generations before it was sold to a family in the 1930s. The current owners bought it four years ago. The estate is now being sold by estate agents Knight Frank for offers over £6million. Clive Hopkins, head of estates at Knight Frank, said: 'This estate is a package that ticks most boxes. 'You've got a listed Regency house that has been refurbished to a high standard but kept traditional features, set in some wonderful compartmentalised gardens which means as you walk round the house you get a different type of garden depending on what window you look out.

Secluded: The sprawling manor, pictured, is set in traditional parkland which has no footpaths through it - offering complete privacy . 'That's then set in traditional parkland which is very private and secluded. There's no rights of way or footpaths through it, which is very rare for a house of that age. 'Rights of way originated from footpaths being made for staff working in a big country house to get back to their village so it's very rare for a house of this stature not to have a path. 'It's a really big draw in this day and age, owners want privacy but don't want to be too remote. 'This estate has no road noise, no light pollution and no pylons. It's a package which is very rarely found and is highly sought after. 'It would suit someone looking to buy the next stage of house, an estate like Chyknell is the pinnacle of the residential tree. 'The current owners are only moving because they have found an estate with more land. He is very keen on his cricket and put a cricket pitch in here so he could get his friends round for a game. It's not quite a Lord's, but it's a very high standard, he bought all the equipment, rollers and things. 'With this estate you get a lot of bricks and mortar for your money. Not many estates like this come up and when they do they are highly sought after.'

{"document": "Tracey Neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers. She might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success. At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just £742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. She is Phil Neville's twin and I ask her which of them, back on January 21, 1977, emerged first. 'I don't think there was ever any way Philip was coming out before me,' she says in a broad Bury accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter. Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville . Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year . England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends . It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to £4million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire — and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, interviews Neville over breakfast at Hotel Football . Phil Neville, who now works as pundit with BT Sport and the BBC, takes a selfie with his twin sister . Neville celebrates with her Manchester Thunder team after clinching the Superleague title in April last year . 'I think we're all natural leaders,' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at Hotel Football, which stands next to Old Trafford and counts her brothers and Manchester United's other 'Class of 92' players among its main investors. 'I'd say I'm quite intense, like Gary. He and I would clash quite a lot. Not to the detriment of our relationship. We're very close. But Philip would be the mediator.' So Phil's the nice one? 'I think I am,' she says, chuckling again. 'I'm probably not as intense as Gary and I'm not the mediator that Philip is. I'm somewhere in the middle. I have bits of both personality traits. 'But I can definitely hold my own with the two of them. I'm probably the one who winds Gary up, to be honest. Being a girl I probably know how to push his buttons.' She says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at United or by the fact that Gary's best mate was David Beckham. 'I knew them all when they were earning £29.50 a week in digs,' she says. And she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice. 'We never had those kind of conversations,' she says. 'And Gary and clothes? I don't think they are ever in the same conversation really (cue more laughter). Neville, who will manage England at the netball World Cup, believes she is a natural leader like her brothers . Gary Neville (left) leads Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Michael Carrick (L-R) in England training . Neville represents England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur aged just 21 . 'But we have an awesome dynamic. We obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other. As kids we were like a pack of cubs. We always looked after our own and that's still the case today. We rely on that support system.' Even as kids, her brothers treated her as an equal. 'I was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football,' she says. 'I was always pretty good at all sports and I would give it my all. 'I would have been a good footballer. I loved playing. My mum was the footballer in the family. She played as a striker. That didn't rub off because like Gary and Phil I was a defender. In the end the big decision I had to make was between hockey and netball. I'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option I took.' Understandably, there is what she describes as 'a certain connection' with Phil. 'We probably speak more,' she says. 'Because Gary's so busy I would see more of his family, his kids, than I do him. 'He never talks about himself. He won the award last week (best sports presenter at the RTS Awards) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it. He wouldn't say he wants to be the next England manager because his focus will be on the job he's doing at the moment. And when I told Gary I'd got this job, it was just a one-word text response. 'Brilliant,' he said. There was more from Philip. 'Unbelievable. So proud.' I think he tweeted something. That's the difference.' Before Australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers. Phil spent a season as assistant coach to David Moyes at Manchester United. Given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville would love to have a coffee with Sir Alex Ferguson and pick his brains before the netball World Cup . Phil Neville spent last season on the coaching staff at Manchester United, with 10 months under David Moyes . Neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in Bristol and sports science degree in Chester . 'If he wouldn't mind having a coffee with me I'd love to do that,' she says. 'But I've got 30 minutes booked in with Gary. 'There are certain challenges in our sport. It's difficult for the girls to be full-time, and often their jobs become more important because there isn't the financial support. 'I had some difficult financial times as a player. I had great support from my family but I had to take different jobs to support myself. 'I worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and I studied too. I got a maths degree in Bristol before studying for a sports science degree in Chester. These days I'm working with girls who are doctors, lawyers, zoologists. 'But I think I'm a better coach than I ever was a player. One of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way I build a team around a certain ethos. I also have a good understanding of the game.' The challenge is nevertheless significant, as Australia and New Zealand are the powerhouses in netball. 'The Sport England target is to get to the final but we've never made a final before,' she says. 'Last year we finished fourth in the Commonwealths. The team didn't perform to their best so it's my job to get them doing that. 'Ideally I'd like to have had longer to prepare. In a perfect world you'd get a four-year cycle. 'Right now the future beyond the World Cup is uncertain. We'll just have to see how it goes. But I had to take this opportunity. I've always had such passion for England.' She's certainly not alone there. lnformation on Manchester Thunder's semi-final at the Manchester Arena is at www.manchesterthunder.com .", "summary": "Tracey Neville is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville .\nShe will manage England at the netball World Cup in Australia this summer .\nTracey believes her personality is a mixture of her brothers'\nShe would love to pick the brains of Man United legend Sir Alex Ferguson ."}

The toddler suffered horrific facial injuries after the Alaskan Malamute crossed with a Siberian Huskey clamped its jaws around her head at their home in Neyland, Pembrokeshire. She was playing in the garden on Thursday afternoon when her family heard screams and ran to find their eight-year-old dog 'gripping' the three-year-old by her head. A three-year-old girl was airlifted to Morriston Hospital (pictured) in Swansea after being mauled in the face by her family's pet dog . They wrestled the animal free but the toddler suffered deep puncture wounds to her face and skull. Her injuries were so severe that she had to be airlifted to Morriston Hospital in Swansea 60 miles away and her family are currently at her bedside. The dog was taken to a nearby vet and the family gave permission for their pet to be destroyed. A Dyfed Powys Police spokesman said: 'The incident occurred inside the family home and was by all accounts an attack that came completely out of the blue. Newborn Eliza-Mae Mullane (pictured) was killed by an Alaskan Malamoute in March 2014 . 'The dog had not been left unsupervised with the little girl and if it had not been for the fast actions of a family member, her injuries could have been far more serious. 'Police have thoroughly looked into this matter and are satisfied that this was a very unfortunate incident that no one could have foreseen. There will be no further investigation. 'She sustained head injuries and was conveyed to Morriston Hospital in Swansea by Air Ambulance. Her condition is not life threatening. 'Following the police response to the incident, the dog was safely contained and taken to a local vet. 'In accordance with the wishes of the family the dog was destroyed.' A six-day-old baby girl was killed by an Alaskan Malamoute 40 miles away in the village of Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire in March 2014. Eliza-Mae Mullane was pulled from her pram and bitten by the family's pet dog at her home, an inquest heard. Neighbours heard the baby's mother Sharon John, 42, scream: 'The dog ate my baby's head', after discovering her body next to the dog called Nisha. Alaskan Malamute are not a banned breed under the Dangerous Dogs Act. They were originally bred as sled dogs for work in the Arctic, but are now popular as family pets. The Alaskan Malamute Club of the United Kingdom describes the breed as an 'affectionate, friendly, loyal, devoted companion' on its website.

{"document": "Gifted: Schoolgirl Elspeth McKendrick was depressed after being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome . A gifted schoolgirl hanged herself  just weeks after scoring a string of GCSE A stars because she was depressed at being diagnosed with a mild form of autism, an inquest heard. School prefect Elspeth McKendrick, 16, was left shattered in 2012 when doctors diagnosed her with Asperger's syndrome. The Doctor Who and Sherlock fan, who was described by her mother as 'geeky', had desperately wanted to fit in at school and had built up a small circle of friends. Her parents said  she was 'happy to be odd and eccentric' but was 'very much in denial' about her condition and  felt unable to discuss  it with anybody. Last August, just a week after going on a school trip as part of the National Citizen Service, the teenager was found hanged in her bedroom after leaving a note apologising to her family and telling how she wished she could open up to friends. The inquest in Heywood, Greater Manchester, heard how Elspeth, from Bury, had been an artistic and creative pupil at Tottington High School. She was an avid reader who always had a novel in her school bag and had already won a place at Manchester College of Art to study A levels. But her mother Rebecca Jackson, 47, told the hearing. 'She had told of problems socialising and making close friends. 'Although she had a lot of friends she also wanted to have a close best friend and she did not have that. 'There were behavioural issues and tantrums that were beyond my experience of normal teenage tantrums because, for Elspeth, things were black and white. Elspeth was very tech savvy and she enjoyed using the computer. 'It caused an awful lot of problems. We got woken up in the middle of the night at 2am when she was on the computer or at 4am when she was not sleeping. She was existing on four hours a night then. It was Elspeth's way or the high way.' In 2011 Elspeth went to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in Bury and was upset to be diagnosed with Asperger's the following year. Mrs Jackson said: 'She was very geeky and enjoyed a lot of things like Albert Einstein and she loved films and cinematography. 'There are a lot of film directors with Asperger's so it doesn't mean there is anything mentally wrong with you, just a difference in the way you think. 'I tried to present it in a positive light to her and was recommended a book about Asperger's and teenagers and it was really positive. 'I bought it for Elspeth and she tore it into shreds and then was very sorry and tried to sellotape it back together. She was very much in denial.' Elspeth poses with a cardboard cut-out of Tom Jones. She was described as an artistic and creative pupil  and had already won a place at Manchester College of Art to study A levels . Elspeth's father Euan, 43, told the inquest: 'She was not happy about her diagnosis and she wanted to be Elspeth and felt the diagnosis was a waste of time. CAMHS she saw as toxic and not about her and more about her mother's needs and not her needs. 'When she was good she was fantastic, when she lost it she really did. Most of it was stropping and slamming the door. There were a few bad ones that were horrific - shouting, swearing and calling names, saying the most terrible things.' 'She did feel an awful lot of pressure. She felt she was being observed. I am afraid she did not like being watched or observed. Part of the CAMHS problem was that she was convinced they were taking notes about her and sharing it with her mother. 'Alone': The inquest heard how Elspeth struggled to discuss her condition with friends . 'She kept her choice of college secret. She didn't want people to know what she was doing or where she was going. She felt she was in a fish bowl all of the time. 'She did not want the diagnosis - she just wanted to be a bit odd. She was happy being odd, a bit eccentric.' Det Insp Denise Pye of Great Manchester Police said a note had been found on top of Elspeth's laptop apologising for what she had done as well as a notebook containing school work and comments about her feelings. DI Pye said: 'She felt she was alone and wanted to tell friends how she felt but felt she couldn't do so. 'Some of the positive stuff seems to refer to the challenge she went on and the negative stuff was that she felt she did not have contact with people she should after the challenge because she made such good friends and felt so good about that.' Elspeth's clinical psychologist at Bury CAMHS, Neil Wilson, told the inquest: 'Elspeth was at the subtle end of the autism spectrum. Someone who might meet her for the first time would not probably regard her as having a developmental disorder but as shy and cautious.' Headmaster at Tottington High School, Paul Greenhalgh, said: 'Elspeth was an A star student and had a lovely small group of friends. Elspeth was amazingly creative and artistic. 'But she struggled with the diagnosis of Asperger's and wanted more than anything to fit in. She loved reading and always had a novel in her school bag. 'She was asked to be a prefect in year 11 and did a fine job upholding school rules and requirements. She was a talented student with a depth of intelligence and capability beyond her years.' Assistant Coroner Catherine McKenna recorded a conclusion of suicide and said: 'I am conscious that Elspeth was a very private young woman and would probably not be happy that we've had this Inquest. She was a bright witty talented young woman and she had much to look forward to in her life.'

{"document": "It might look like something plucked straight from the future, but Chevrolet’s latest innovation is actually their vision of tomorrow’s self-driving electric vehicle. Called the Chevrolet-FNR, it boasts a futuristic capsule design among other interesting features. The car is only a concept for now, but offers a glimpse and what some manufacturers are planning for the upcoming self-driving car era. General Motors has unveiled the Chevrolet-FNR car (shown). It has 'dragonfly' swing doors that open upwards and 'crystal laser headlights' The car was unveiled at the Shanghai General Motors Gala Night this week. It was developed in Shanghai by GM’s Pan Asia Technical Automotive Centre (PATAC) joint venture. Chevrolet said the car offered a ‘glimpse at mobility of the future.’ The ‘aim was to create a unique, intelligent vehicle for tomorrow’s younger consumers by utilizing innovative car networking technology,’ said GM. It has crystal laser headlights and taillights and ‘dragonfly’ dual swing doors that open upwards. The car also has magnetic hubless electric wheel motors and a wireless autocharging system. Sensors and roof-mounted radar are used to map the environment nearby for self-driving mode, and you can even turn on the car with your eyes, thanks to its iris recognition start. The car is self-driving, electric, and the front chairs can swivel round (shown). And using iris recognition software you can start it using only your eyes . The car was unveiled at the Shanghai General Motors Gala Night this week (shown) Chevrolet said the car offered a ‘glimpse at mobility of the future' The ‘aim was to create a unique, intelligent vehicle for tomorrow’s younger consumers by utilizing innovative car networking technology,’ said the company . While in self-driving mode, the front seats of the vehicle swivel 180 degrees to face the rear seats, so the driver can talk to their passengers. Using a gesture control feature, though, the driver can switch to manual control mode whenever they want. Chevrolet notes that the car is just a concept, so there is no release date or planned production date yet. ‘The FNR concept reaffirms Chevrolet’s commitment to offer electric vehicles that meet customer’s lifestyles and are within their reach,’ said Alan Batey, head of global Chevrolet. At the event Chevrolet also unveiled a new car in its Malibu range, the Bolt EV Concept vehicle and the 2015 Captiva. Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little, but they can also increase travel sickness, research has found. The research was carried out by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. They asked more than 3,200 adults across the US, India, China, Japan, Great Britain and Australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle.

Arshdeep Kaur and her mother Shinder, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India, to visit relatives when a group of about half a dozen men began harassing them. The men grabbed Arshdeep and made several attempts to 'molest' her and her mother, but instead of defending them, the bus staff joined in the sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Victims: Arshdeep Kaur, 14, and her mother Shinder, pictured in hospital, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India,  when passengers and bus staff sexually assaulted them . The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province. Mrs Kaur, 38, daughter Arshdeep, 14, and son Akashdeep Singh, had taken the bus from their home village to visit Mrs Kaur's parents, Tribune India reports. Shortly after boarding the bus, a group of men had surrounded mother and daughter and tried to grab both of them. Mrs Kaur alerted the conductor about the harassment, he joined in and started abusing them both. After fighting off her attackers, Mrs Kaur ran through the bus to tell the driver to stop the bus, but according to her testimony, he started driving faster. The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province . Vital issue: Officials recently banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an 23-year-old student in Delhi (stock image) The assault continued until the bus slowed down and mother and daughter could break free, however as they attempted to get off the bus, Mrs Kaur says they were pushed. Arshdeep and Mrs Kaur both suffered serious injuries, and the 14-year-old later died in hospital. 'No one helped. They first pushed my daughter off the bus, then me,' Mrs Kaur told NDTV from her hospital bed today. Shortly after the pair had been pushed off, the bus stopped by the roadside and the alleged perpetrators, including the conductor, cleaner and driver fled the scene. The three could later be apprehended and police have launched an investigation into the incident. There has a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India in recent weeks after officials banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary, called India's Daughter, would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators.", "summary": "Arshdeep and Shinder Kaur were sexually assaulted on a bus in Punjab .\nA group surrounded them, and bus staff joined when they complained .\nWhen Mrs Kaur, 38, alerted the driver, he answered by driving faster .\nArshdeep, 14, died and Mrs Kaur seriously injured after being pushed off ."}

{"document": "Encounters with common dolphins off the west of Scotland have more than doubled over a decade, according to experts. And now research is under way to find out why, with scientists proposing that climate change may have caused the surge in numbers. Common dolphins were once a rare sight in the Hebrides, preferring warmer waters found further south, leading experts to believe that global warming has led to pods moving north. Encounters with common dolphins (a stock image is shown) off the west of Scotland have more than doubled over a decade, according to a leading research body. Monitoring by Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust teams has seen the number of encounters increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years . Monitoring by Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust teams has seen the number of encounters with common dolphins increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years. The dolphins come to the Hebrides in spring to take advantage of seasonal food stocks, travelling in large groups and sometimes forming ‘super-pods’ of thousands of individuals. The species, which are smaller than the area’s resident bottlenose dolphins, often approach boats and play in the wake, the trust said. While they were once drawn to warmer waters above 10°C south of the area, climate change is  causing sea surface temperatures in the Hebrides to rise by around 0.5 °C a decade. And warmer water species appear to be colonising new areas further north or closer to shore, the trust said. The dolphins are moving further north than they did decades ago, possibly because the water has become warmer. While the shift could create new feeding opportunities for the common dolphins, it could increase competition between other types of dolphin or seabirds. An Oystercatcher on the Isle of Mull is shown . The shift north could be creating new opportunities for the common dolphins to find food in new areas, but may mean the species is competing for fish with other types of dolphin or seabirds. Volunteers will live, work and sleep on Silurian research ship for up to 12 days. They will receiving training and work with scientists to conduct visual surveys, acoustic monitoring using specialist equipment, and cetacean identification through dorsal fin photography. They will also help run Silurian - giving them a chance to learn to sail and navigate. Areas covered depend on the weather but will range from Mull of Kintyre in the south, Cape Wrath in the north and St Kilda in the west. These seas are one of Europe’s most important cetacean habitats. Participation costs range from £683 to £1,500 to cover boat expenses, accommodation, training, food and insurance, and support the trust’s research. More information can be found at HWDT. Colder water species such as the white beaked dolphin could be forced to retreat further north, and while the trust said it had found no evidence of the white beaked dolphin being displaced, continued monitoring of the situation is needed. The charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel Silurian to help conduct visual surveys and acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans. This includes dolphins, whales and porpoises. Dr Conor Ryan, sightings and strandings officer at Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust said: ‘An increase in common dolphins means that those wishing to encounter dolphins in the wild are in luck - but further research is needed to explain why this is happening, the extent to which it has been caused by human activity and the implications for other cetacean species.’ Kerry Froud, the trust’s biodiversity officer, added: ‘Our research expeditions depend on volunteers. ‘In return they offer the opportunity of a lifetime to contribute to a better understanding of cetaceans and basking sharks, whilst enjoying the beautiful scenery of Scotland’s west coast and experiencing exhilarating sailing.

{"document": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto . The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend . And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight . The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit . King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy . The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013 . A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one. 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.", "summary": "Spanish football manager tore the side of his trousers exposing his thigh .\nGuardiola said later: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match'\nTrend for tight suits has seen Dermot O'Leary and Olly Murs left red-faced .\nFashion blogger says men shouldn't 'stuff themselves' into too-snug suits ."}

{"document": "While we all know the key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding a middle ground between the amount of food you eat and the amount of exercise you put in, it can sometimes be a bit tricky to anticipate exactly how much exercise is required. With Easter just around the corner we thought it would be helpful to give you a real life gauge on how much cardio you'll need to put in to get the most out of your Easter binge session. Starting at the very bottom of the chocolate egg scale is the mini solid egg, around four of them equate to 550 kilojules. After eating only four mini solid chocolate eggs that contain 550 kilojules you'll need to run for at least 40 minutes to melt the calories away . A 67-kilogram woman who ate only four of these snack sized treats would need to vigorously walk for around 40 minutes before the guilt, and the calories melted away. A man weighing in at around 80 kilograms could achieve the same in 30 minutes. Any child, or grown adult for that matter, out on an Easter scavenger hunt is sure to come across a chocolate replica of the Easter bunny himself. You would need to run for about half an hour to burn off a hollow chocolate egg . What you’ll be surprised to find is that a medium chocolate bunny contains around 4400 kilojules that won’t burn themselves off. If you chose the humble kayak as your weapon against weight gain, ladies you'd be expected to paddle for at least three hours to burn that bunny off.

{"document": "The Mamma Mia ballad Our Last Summer will feel even more poignant in the coming months as the Broadway show is set to end its 14 year long run in September. But it seems fans need not worry as there will soon be a restaurant inspired by the successful show, opened by ABBA star Bjorn Ulvaeus. The Mamma Mia inspired eatery will open its doors a block away from the ABBA museum in Stockholm. Mamma Mia here we go again! Fans of the long-running Broadway show need not worry as a new inspired restaurant is opening in Sweden . Bjorn Ulvaeus, of Swedish pop group ABBA, has unveiled his new musical project, a Mamma Mia inspired restaurant performance, set to open in January 2016 . Bjorn aims to transport the party atmosphere from theatre aisles to inside a Greek taverna. The venue is scheduled to open in January 2016, and is a part restaurant, part stage show and part role play, focusing on audience interaction. Of course audiences will be able to sing and dance to the Swedish sensations' 1970s tunes, to their hearts' content. 'They will be part of a little story in real time, which will be played out during the evening,' said 69-year-old Bjorn. The model reveals there will be olive trees, fountains and scents of Mediterranean. The restaurant is situated near the ABBA-museum in central Stockholm . The musical will include all the ABBA classics from the show, and a couple of ones not featured . The Swedish singer sent fans into a frenzy after revealing on a new website he was creating a 'new entertainment experiment' Fans will recognise the Greek-island setting, but will experience a slightly different story which will change night to night depending how the audience react. The play focuses on the Greek taverna called Nicos' Taverna owned by a man in his 50s and his slightly younger Swedish wife. If the concept proves to be a success Ulvaeus didn't rule out transferring it to other countries. 'I see actually no reason why not,' he said. 'So maybe if we find a good place in London, Hamburg or wherever, there will be a Nicos' Taverna as well.' Bjorn will transform a restaurant to a Greek tavern for guests, staff, musicians and artists. He hopes to create a party in an environment like the one from the island of Skopelos, where the movie Mamma Mia was filmed . Worldwide fans will be keen to see if this follows in the footsteps of the beloved show, which has grossed more than $600 million and been seen by over seven million people. The show opened two years after it first hit the stage in London in 1999, and has since been made into a blockbuster film starring Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Piers Brosnan and Colin Firth, to name a few. For years the show took in nearly $1 million a week at the box office, however sales have declined in more recent years, averaging half that amount. Ulvaeus said the three other members of ABBA — Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad — are not part of the restaurant venture but know about it 'and wish it well.' The show was made into a successful film with a A-list cast including Dominic Cooper and Amanda Seyfried .", "summary": "The Broadway show is finishing after 14 years on stage .\nFormer ABBA singer Bjorn Ulvaeus will be creating the musical venture .\nGuests will experience all the beloved ABBA songs in a Greek taverna .\nThe show will open in Stockholm in Sweden in January 2016 ."}

The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of £17,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of £675 and a victim surcharge of £50. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.'

Football star: Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club . She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised £10,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of £17,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than £10,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it.

{"document": "A Tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting. Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a Labour rival, Theo Blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand: Jonny Bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings . The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London. Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eating . When he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. 'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. 'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet. 'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's. 'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.' The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday. 'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said. He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013. Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him. After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner. 'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.'

{"document": "Activated charcoal is thought to act as a 'detox' Are you the first to jump on the latest food fad bandwagon? Do you regularly 'detox' with a green tea or a wheatgrass juice? Or pack your diet full of flax seeds and acai berry - all in the hope of improving your cholesterol, preventing cancer and promoting weight loss? Every day across the world scientists publish countless studies into the health benefits of various foods. For example, acai berries have been linked to weight loss and cancer prevention, flax seeds are thought to help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease, while coconut oil has been hailed as a weight loss aid. More recently charcoal, freekah, spiralizing and bone broth have emerged as the latest craze in healthy eating. Each comes with its own promise, with claims of 'melting away fat cells', 'supercharging the metabolism', and 'regenerating and revitalising'. But what is the truth? I am often asked in clinic about fad diets and products by patients, desperate to find a quick way to shift the pounds. Some of these fads are clearly bonkers, with no scientific evidence to back them up. Others have some basis in common-sense and may be worth including in the healthy, balanced, real-food appproach to eating that is the only way to succeed in the long term. I asked Sophie Claessens, our Vavista dietitian, to pick the 'miracle' foods from the fads... ACTIVATED CHARCOAL . Due to its use by medical professionals in the effective treatment of toxic poisoning, some believe that taking active charcoal, often in the form of a capsule can ‘detox’ the body. However it’s not as easy as that; the charcoal will only remove certain poisons and only if they have recently been ingested and are therefore not yet absorbed. Is it worth trying? No. Firstly, ‘detoxing’ is a word my colleagues and I don’t agree with. We should be aiming for an everything in moderation approach rather than a ‘binge-detox’ cycle. Secondly, activated charcoal has only been shown to be effective for acute poisoning such as certain drug-overdoses, not an accumulation of toxins over time. And what are these accumulated ‘toxins’? Calories? Fat? Carbohydrates? As far as we’re concerned, all of these contribute to a healthy balanced diet - just don’t overdo them. The spiraliser gadget turns various vegetables into spaghetti, helping to boost weight loss . SPIRALIZING . This new gadget is getting everyone in a spin. Take vegetables such as courgettes and carrots and turn them into low-carbohydrate 'spaghetti' in just a few seconds. Great to up your veg intake, increase your fibre intake and reduce your calorie intake, but is it really a healthy addition to the kitchen? Is it a healthy craze? Well, yes and no. We should all be aiming to get as much veg into our diet as possible as it provides us with a low calorie source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. But be careful not to use the spiraliser vegetables as a replacement for complex starchy carbohydrates like pasta, which are required for energy and other important nutrients. If you’re topping your spaghetti dish with spiralised veg or they’re accompanying a meat and potato dish then go for it, have as much as you like. But using the spiraliser to replace carbohydrates in your diet can lead to tiredness, fluctuating weight patterns and poor concentration. FREEKAH . Quinoa is so last year… this new grain on the block is what everyone’s talking about now. Freekeh is a young green wheat which is roasted to remove the husks, giving a smoky, nutty flavour which is popular in the Middle East. Should I give it a go? Yes. It’s easy to cook and can be added to salads, soups and rice dishes easily and deliciously. It’s a low glycaemic index type of carbohydrate with four times the fibre count of quinoa, so will help to keep you fuller for longer and is good for heart health. It also boasts plenty of vitamins such as calcium and iron. The only downside is that it’s pretty expensive. FERMENTED FOODS . How many times have you heard about ‘good bacteria’ and wondered what it’s all about? You may also have heard about pre and probiotics. It’s all based on the principle that our bodies are absolutely filled with bacteria, most of which are good; in fact we wouldn’t be able to survive without them. Fermented foods, including pickled cabbage, act as a probiotic - encouraging the growth of 'good' bacteria . So it seems right that we should treat them right by adding pre-biotics to our diet to encourage growth of the good bacteria and maybe try a daily probiotic which contain cultures of good bacteria to add to our gut population. Fermented foods such as yoghurt, cheese and Asian pickled ingredients such as Kimchi (pickled cabbage) are an example of probiotics. Are they good for me? Yes. There’s more and more evidence to suggest that having a healthy population of bacteria is important for eveything from a smooth digestion process to preventing side-effects of antibiotic medication. Taking a daily probiotic is also fairly easy in the form of a probiotic yoghurt or yoghurt drink. SPROUTED FOODS . It's now being claimed that the intake of sprouted wholegrains can have health benefits over and above those delivered with your plain old standard wholegrains such as rice, wheat and oats. The theory goes that we harvest our grains prematurely, not allowing them to sprout, like an onion would if left. Bone broth has a much lower salt content than shop bought soups, helping lower blood pressure . When sprouted, we are able to digest the grains more readily and absorb more nutrients such as protein, B vitamins and minerals such as iron and calcium. There’s lots of evidence emerging of their impact on health such as decreasing blood pressure and fighting diabetes. Should I invest at the supermarket? Maybe. They may provide you with lots of vitamins and minerals which you wouldn’t naturally yield from the standard grain, but they’re a fairly expensive product. You can also find these vitamins and minerals from a varied diet containing plenty of fruit, veg, calcium-rich dairy products (or alternatives), wholegrains and meat, fish or alternatives. BONE BROTH . This has recently made famous by the health-conscious chefs the Hemsley sisters. In fact, it’s been around for centuries and has always been used as stock, as a base in soups and saucy dishes. It’s also well-known for its health benefits, with the bone-boiling process leaching out amino acids, collagen - for skin and bone health - and other important vitamins and minerals. Adding onions or leeks, carrots and celery, and any other old veg that you have lying around, will add antioxidants along with flavour. Shall I join the club? Yes . Your mother, grandmother and great-grandmothers have probably been using this recipe for hundreds of years. Traditionally it is used to add flavour to dishes but it’s also a great way to add nutrients without much effort. Plus it has a much lower salt content than using shop-bought stocks, so is much better for your blood pressure. ...BUT NOW A WORD OF WARNING . Food fads are named such usually because they’re an unsustainable fashion trend. Some can even be dangerous. Have a think to yourself when you hear of the new craze; are you being advised to ingest something which sounds inedible? Would I find it hard to keep the changes up long-term? If so, they’re probably not a sensible idea. Another point to remember is that just because they’re being sold in a health food or wholefoods shop, it doesn’t mean they’re ‘healthy’. You can still buy chocolate from these shops. Sorry to burst your bubble, but just because you buy it from a health food shop, it doesn’t magically become healthy. We would suggest that you do your research before rushing into anything.

{"document": "Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows. Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents’ generation. Scroll down for video . Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest . Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country’s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK’s skin cancer expert: ‘It’s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. ‘It’s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. ‘It’s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. ‘Melanoma is often detected on men’s backs and women’s legs but can appear on any part of the body.’ Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said: ‘Many cases of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are preventable by taking precautions in the sun and making sure you don’t burn. ‘Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don’t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. ‘You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. ‘Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.’ Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: ‘I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. ‘I don’t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. ‘And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. ‘I’ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. ‘I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I’m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. ‘Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.’", "summary": "Decades of cheap holidays means retirees are paying for sunburn in youth .\nMen over 65 ten times more likely to have disease than parents' generation .\nAround 5,700 pensioners now diagnosed with melanoma each year in UK ."}

{"document": "(CNN)The verdict of the opinion polls on the UK election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough: Between David Cameron of the Conservatives, Ed Miliband of Labour, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party, Natalie Bennett of the Green Party, Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists, there really was no clear winner. Comres for ITV, which staged the debate, had Cameron, Miliband and Farage tied first with 21% and Sturgeon close behind on 20%. ICM for The Guardian scored it Miliband 25, Cameron 24, Farage 19 and Sturgeon 17. YouGov for The Times put Sturgeon first with 28 points to 20 for Farage, 18 for Cameron and only 15 for Miliband. Back in the 1950s, UK politics was simpler: Labour and Conservatives combined took 97% of the votes. But nowadays they struggle to collect two-thirds of the national vote between them. In our anti-politics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders' TV debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome. Rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties' supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter. From a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons: . As the incumbent Prime Minister, Cameron is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with Miliband alone in verbal fisticuffs. He has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision. Miliband has been given a hard time by the British media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek. But Labour's leader is a perfectly capable debater. He could only gain from their confrontation. As it is, election time media exposure has already seen Miliband's ratings as a leader improve. The electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging. In an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by UK TV's Grand Inquisitor Jeremy Paxman, Cameron proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration, on the number of people employed on zero-hours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies. Miliband has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration; he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother David to get the leader's job. The impression so far is that Britain's voters don't much like the Conservatives despite the recovering economy but don't quite trust Labour to continue the improvement. Miliband, told by his handlers to look tough, is using the \"i\" word too much. Cameron is curiously short on passion. An oddity of the Seven Up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved, Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Wood of Plaid Cymru. But Sturgeon's high score in the post-debate polls was significant. She was sharp and sassy. The number of seats gained by the Nationalists, currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 Westminster Parliament seats in Scotland, will be crucial. Last time Labour won 41 of those seats: The more the SNP take, the weaker Labour's chance of a majority at Westminster will be. Miliband says he won't form a coalition with the SNP but it could be difficult for Labour to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border. If there was a \"winner\" in the debate it was Nicola Sturgeon. Back in the 2010 UK election debates the clear victor was Clegg of the Liberal Democrats. Then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting \"I agree with Nick.\" By entering a coalition government with Cameron (in which the Lib Dems' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery), Clegg surrendered the Lib Dems' previous ability to pick up protest votes. Clegg and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government, notably on student tuition fees. His debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10%. Perception is everything. In social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the Greens and even for Plaid Cymru's Wood but Clegg got hardly a mention. The United Kingdom Independence Party remains the joker in the pack. The party once dismissed by Cameron as a collection of \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\" is a serious threat to the Conservatives -- and Labour -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately. But UKIP, more than any of the others, is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them. Grinning Farage's blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration. His party won't win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests, sometimes taking votes off the Conservatives, sometimes off Labour. Farage has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60% of HIV cases he earned condemnation from other leaders. On social media, dominated by the young, that earned him the maximum boo count. To \"win\" a TV election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself, to wrongfoot your opponent, and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum. You need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays. Nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign. The highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money. The emphasis has been on sound defense: Nobody has yet scored an exciting goal. As the campaign moves on, chances will have to be taken.

{"document": "(CNN)Mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for this year's climbing season, resuming the quest to summit the world's highest peak after a deadly season last year. In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.", "summary": "Climbers are returning to Everest after 2014 season on Nepal side was canceled .\nClimbing permits increase in Tibetan and Nepalese side this year .\n16 Nepalis died in Khumbu Icefall on Everest last year ."}
{"document": "It is the historic site where King John sealed the Magna Carta to establish the rule of law. But just a few hundred yards from the famous setting at Runnymede in Surrey – which the Queen will visit in June to celebrate the document’s 800th anniversary – dozens of anarchists have made their squalid home in a litter-strewn shanty town. Squatting on the private land, the group, who are linked to the Occupy London movement that caused chaos in London when they set up camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral in 2011, have left locals outraged. Squatter Vinny outside one of the make-shift homes the group has set up just yards away from where the Magna Carta was sealed in Runnymede, Surrey . In contrast to the neatly tended Magna Carta memorial nearby, a used condom and grubby mattress lie at the entrance to the ramshackle squatters’ camp. Inside, a Mail on Sunday reporter witnessed one anarchist openly smoking cannabis just feet from a two-year-old child. The battle to evict the squatters is set to come to a head just before the Magna Carta anniversary on June 15. Last Thursday the squatters were granted a stay of execution when a county court judge allowed them two weeks to submit a defence ahead of a hearing next month. One camp leader, Vinny, who would not give his surname, said: ‘This is about using the land to grow our own vegetables. It’s a place to give people life skills, a sanctuary for the displaced.’ The dope-smoking 48-year-old added: ‘Why can’t we have equality with land ownership? Why can’t we have a few acres each?’ Last Thursday the squatters were granted a stay of execution when a county court judge allowed them two weeks to submit a defence ahead of a hearing next month . The camp was set up three years ago in woodland on a disused Brunel University site. Property developers Orchid Runnymede has planning permission to build affordable homes, student accommodation, an elderly care facility, and private housing on the land. But the community of about 30 squatters are refusing to leave. They claim to live off the land, using solar panels for electricity, a freshwater spring to wash and a vegetable patch to grow food, as well as raiding supermarket rubbish bins. King John sealed the Magna Carta to establish the rule of law. Above, a painting illustrating the historic moment . But David Sheldrake, whose farm borders the camp, said they have been stealing from water tanks for his cattle, adding: ‘I’m 69 and there are young people there – able, fit people who don’t want to work.’ One of the camp’s founding members, James Hampson, claims some of the squatters do work full-time. He has not worked since staying at the camp but said he has not claimed any benefits either. The former IT worker said: ‘Our aim here has always been to build a sustainable community.’ Mr Hampson is pledging to peacefully resist any attempt by developers – who recently erected a steel fence around the squat – to retake the land. The squatters’ lifestyle is a far cry from that in the leafy village of Englefield just 200 yards away, where houses fetch more than £1 million. Marketing consultant Lisa Lawson, 55, whose house borders the development site, said: ‘If you really believe in keeping everything nice and living off the land, why is there such a load of rubbish down there?’ Retired engineer Janet Ferstl, 60, added: ‘I used to walk my dogs down there a lot but I don’t any more. I don’t feel safe.’ A spokesman for Arts Estates, which manages the land, said: ‘We are building a valuable development for the community and we have to do so within the laws of the land.’", "summary": "Squatters have set up shanty town just yards from Runnymede in Surrey .\nThe group who are linked to Occupy London have left locals outraged .\nOne member said they were using the land to grow their own vegetables .\nThey have been given two weeks to submit a defence ahead of hearing ."}
{"document": "German air traffic control officials today called for technology that ground staff could use in an emergency to take remote command of a plane. Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month. Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Disaster: Rescue workers and debris from the Germanwings jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France . Call: Klaus-Dieter Scheurle (above), head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month . Mr Scheurle said in Frankfurt: ‘Such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations.’ He added that it was important to ‘think past today's technology’, explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it. Mr Scheurle said that it was not the ‘simplest solution’, adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse.

Tribute: Flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the Germanwings flight in Le Vernet . A spokesman said: ‘We also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement. After all, it's the pilots who are sitting in the cockpit and they're the ones with all the information.’ The British Airline Pilots' Association also urged caution. ‘We must act with careful consideration to ensure new safety risks or concerns are not created, such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft,’ a spokesman said. Since the Germanwings crash, European airlines have implemented a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and Germany has set up a task force with the aviation industry to consider changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots. Commercial planes could be hacked in flight by passengers using the in-flight entertainment system to access flight controls, a US watchdog agency warned last night. Cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. A 'virus or malware’ planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack, one expert told Government Accountability Office investigators. A GAO report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the Federal Aviation Administration must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology. The publication said: ‘Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.’ FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the aviation regulator has begun working with US government security experts including the National Security Agency to identify needed changes. ‘This threat will continue to evolve and it is something that needs to be at the forefront of our thinking,’ he told a Senate oversight panel.

Workers underneath the six-storey structure fled for their lives after the fifth, fourth and third floors crashed down on to the rest of the building - sending a huge cloud of dust into the air. The terrifying incident is just yards from where an underground cable fire ripped through Holborn on April 1 bringing parts of central London to a standstill and costing local firms £40million. Scroll down for video . Building collapse: Hundreds of staff at the Royal Courts of Justice and London School of Economics were evacuated again today after a six-storey structure collapsed . Injury: Police said a 56-year-old man was being treated for injuries this afternoon following the disaster . Staff at both LSE and the Royal Courts of Justice were also evacuated on that occasion and at this stage it is unknown whether the two incidents are related. The collapsed building, located just behind the university, was covered in scaffolding when disaster struck shortly after 4pm this afternoon. Students at LSE were seen evacuating the university's library and have been told to 'stay clear' of the area. One worker suffered head injuries and a broken arm and was treated by colleagues trained in first aid until an ambulance arrived. Two incidents in a matter of weeks: A map shows where the building collapsed today - not far from the underground cable fire that tore through Holborn on April 1 costing local firms an estimated £40million . An air ambulance was seen arriving at the scene this evening and a 56-year-old was taken to hospital with head injuries . He was the only casualty among 30 workers on site at the time. Nathan Kennedy, 28, was working in the site office when the building behind the Royal Court of Justice and LSE began to collapse. He said: 'We are used to big bangs and crashes all the time, that's the nature of demolition. 'I was just finishing off some paperwork when there was a huge crash and a rumble, we knew it was out of the ordinary and everyone ran outside. 'We are trained for this so everyone kept calm, but it was the first time anything like this has happened to me. 'There was a huge dust ball, we were checking everyone was all right when a couple of the first aiders brought out one of the guys. Parts of scaffolding spill over the barrier around the site and a construction vehicle could also be seen among the piles of rubble . The building, located directly behind LSE, is just yards from where the underground cable fire started at the beginning of April, bringing parts of central London to a standstill . 'He had a bad cut on his forehead and I think he could have broken his arm. We are all worried for him, he's called Keiran and he's in his 50s or 60s. 'Everyone is shaken up, we just hope he's all right.' A London Air Ambulance helicopter landed in nearby Lincoln's Inn Fields to pick up the injured man. Workmen have been on site for around five months and demolition was in progress when the collapse occurred. Mr Kennedy added: 'There a stretch around 15 to 20m that's collapsed. We've been here since December, the building was seven floors and we've gone down three. 'There's some heavy machinery on the higher floors, we use a machine called a muncher that chews through the walls, it's like a big claw, that may have fallen down. 'There's been a lot of building work around here but this is far enough away I would be surprised if that had anything to do it.' Speaking at the scene London Fire Brigade station manager John Snelgrove said: 'We have one waking wounded who has been taken to hospital and we are unaware of his condition. A cloud of dust hovers in the air following the building collapse in Holborn, central London . Fire crews attend the scene on Portugal Street, near the London School of Economics, today . People in the vicinity reported feeling the ground shake as part of the huge building collapsed into rubble . 'The collapse is known as a pancake and has taken around third to two thirds of one of the sides down with it. 'Fortuitously the collapse has largely stayed within the site and not hurt any passers by. 'This is a busy area, luckily the building collapsed inwardly, although a few cars were damaged by fallen masonry.' Scotland Yard said: 'We were called at 4.14pm to Portugal Street, Aldwych, following reports of a partial building collapse on a building site. 'Officers, London Ambulance service and London Fiere Brigade are in attendance. One male aged 56 is being treated at the scene. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and road closures are currently in place.' A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'One hundred people were evacuated from the building site and a further 100 people were evacuated from nearby properties. A safety cordon is in place.' The London School of Economics (LSE) Students' Union's Twitter account tweeted a picture of the scene and said it was 'just by' the LSE campus. And LSE assistant professor Bryan Roberts tweeted: 'Building just collapsed next to my office at LSE in Holborn. When the structure came down there were 30 men working on the site - luckily just one was injured . Students at the London School of Economics have been evacuated and told to 'stay clear' of the area . 'Some workers hurt. Shook the whole campus. Ambulances just arrived at LSE where the building fell down. It's the old London School of Business building.' Eyewitness Murat Akkulak, a research co-ordinator at the Royal College of Surgeons, told the BBC: 'There was a lot of dust but I could see there was a digger down amongst the rubble and one or two builders were running around trying to get someone out of the digger. 'They seem to have had a really lucky escape to me, because everything else had just collapsed around them.' The incident comes just weeks after a fire on nearby Kingsway, which was caused by faulty electrical cables underground, sending thick clouds of smoke into the air - engulfing buildings. Dramatic photographs from the scene showed crowds of people on the street as power cuts hit office buildings.

{"document": "(CNN)An Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan. The report, entitled \"Their Lives on the Line,\" examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials. Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world. Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence. But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets. In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard. In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20% from the previous year, although the number of civilian victims had decreased, said Amnesty in the report. The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Afghanistan at the time, Jan Kubis, told the U.N. Security Council that \"the majority (of women killed) is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country. \"Women activists have been deliberately targeted.\" And according to the human rights group, little support has come from those in power. \"The Afghan government has done very little to protect them,\" Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, Horia Mosadiq, tells CNN. \"Perpetrators almost always walk free, and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored. \"Many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities, it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded.\" During the attack on Farkhunda, \"many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed,\" says Mosadiq. Twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack, but she argues that this is insufficient. \"Suspending police officers is not enough, those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence.\" But what is striking is the resilience of the activists, who continue their work despite their lives being on the line. \"It was a remarkable moment,\" says Mosadiq, recalling the female protesters at Farkhunda's funeral. \"Unlike anything I have seen in my decades of campaigning for women's rights in our country.\" Selay Ghaffer, 32, is a women's rights activist and spokesperson for the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in Kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy, social justice and women's rights. The party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing Afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice. Taking part in Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death, she tells CNN that despite the onslaught of violence against Afghan women over the years, this was the worst case. But the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message. \"So the women of Afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore... And we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women,\" said Ghaffer. \"So this is why we decided to carry the dead body of Farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that (a) man has to do this job.\" Surprisingly, she says that male onlookers supported their mission, although they are in the minority overall in the country. \"Men (at the funeral), they said you have to do this, because this is how you can change the hatred in Afghanistan. \"Without men, it is not possible for women to get their rights,\" she says. \"So these men and women were working together. But at the same time, women need to step forward for their rights.\" Mosadiq says the fight for women's rights was established a while ago. \"Women's activism in Afghanistan is nothing new -- the women's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001, and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains. \"These gains are under threat now, however, and some are even rolled back. It's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen.\" Ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work, received through emails and phone calls, at her home and office. But she says she knew what she was getting herself into. \"I knew it wasn't an easy task. There might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights. \"As a woman, I want to struggle more (for my rights), I want to have more people around me, to struggle with me.\" Mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution, although the response to Farkhunda's killing, from both men and women, has been a \"silver lining.\" Ghaffer, however, believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving. Interestingly, it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight. \"I must say strongly that it was my father (who inspired me), who is not any more with me, because he... died three months ago,\" she says. \"He always told me that women always suffered in this country,\" she says, her voice overcome with emotion. \"And you have to struggle for your rights. Because in this traditional, patriarchal society, nobody will give these rights (to) you.\" She realizes how lucky she is, she adds, in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models. Ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women, not least to the victim of the recent, horrific mob violence. \"So if I should not do it, if another sister is not doing it, then who will do it? Who will get the rights for us? We have to struggle for it. \"If we keep our silence, more Farkhundas will be killed in this country.\"", "summary": "An Amnesty International report calls for attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan to be investigated .\nThe report examines the persecution of activists not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials .\nSome activists continue their work despite their lives being at risk ."}

De Bruyne, who spent his two years at Chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed Bundesliga club, has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league's assist charts with 16 – seven more than the next best. But Ribery says despite his impressive form the 23-year-old Belgian is the wrong style of player to come in under Pep Guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the Holland winger.

The Wolfsburg playmaker, here in action for Belgium against Israel, has 16 assists and nine goals this season . Bayern's Franck Ribery says despite De Bruyne's impressive form he is the wrong type of player for Munich . 'He is not a player who takes the ball and dribbles forward and likes to have the opponents in front of him,' Ribery told German publication Sport Bild.

But he is a good player and he is still young, so he can still learn.'

Should Bayern be in the market for a young attacker, however, Ribery knows precisely who he'd want to see at Allianz Arena – De Bruyne's Belgian team-mate Eden Hazard. 'He attacks all of the time. He loves to run at his opponent,' he said. 'But he plays at Chelsea - this could be very expensive for Bayern.' If Bayern do go for De Bruyne, against their outspoken veteran's advice, they'll have competition from Manchester City, who have met with his representatives, along with Paris Saint-Germain. Wolfsburg are said to be keen to hang onto him for at least one more campaign that should include next season's Champions League.

{"document": "(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"", "summary": "Two Australian drug smugglers, part of the Bali Nine, await word whether they'll face a firing squad .\nLess is known about the seven other members of the group ."}

At the time of the killing, in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home, the tight end had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. The defense's first witness was Dr. David Greenblatt, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, who testified  that the drug PCP can cause people to be suddenly violent, even days after smoking it. Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were seen smoking PCP a few days before the crime. Both men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later.

{"document": "United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. United Launch Alliance has unveiled a radical plans for reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' that is slated to take off in 2019.  Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres . The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. Russian-made RD-180 engines currently power ULA's Atlas rocket, but Congress banned further imports as part of trade sanctions enacted after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. ULA said the new rocket's first stage will be powered by a pair of liquid-oxygen and liquefied methane engines under development by Blue Origin. Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told a news conference in Colorado that the engines will be designed to return to Earth, so they can be refurbished and reflown. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to grab them mid-air . Reusing the engines will enable ULA to cut launch costs to about $100 million for a medium-lift booster and about $200 million for heavy-lift variants. This is roughly half the cost of ULA's current Delta 4 Heavy rocket. Initially, ULA will use its existing upper-stage Centaur engine but plans to introduce in 2023 an advanced motor that can recycle waste propellants. Hours after unveiling its next-generation 'Vulcan' rocket,  United Launch Alliance (ULA), ran into its first problem - the rocket's name. 'Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights,' Chuck Beames, president of the Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Aerospace, told Reuters. 'Paul Allen and Vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of SpaceShipOne more than a decade ago. We are flattered by ULA's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket 'Vulcan',' Beames said. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, selected Vulcan as the name of its new booster, which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019, after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative. 'We have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name Vulcan,' ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email. 'ULA is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so,' she said. This, it claims, will greatly extend its orbital lifetime and the number of missions it can perform. 'We can take multiple satellites into orbit. We can put them in different planes,' Bruno said. 'When we get done with that, we can fly back to the space station. We can do all sorts of things. This is truly a game-changer.' ULA also plans to reduce its launch pads from five to two, and offer a standardised menu of fixed launch prices, much like SpaceX, which posts its Falcon rocket pricing on its website. Bruno declined to say how much Vulcan's development will cost, but added such efforts typically run at least $2 billion. ULA will use its own profits to bankroll the venture. SpaceX, meanwhile, is also hoping to transform the rocket business. Today, it attempted to land the first-stage booster of a Falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The attempt didn't go to plan, with the rocket booster tipped over after landing. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks an important step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. SpaceX founder, Elon Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference.

{"document": "There will be calls for England to get rid of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott on the back of their failures here but I think they should both play all three Tests against West Indies before any sort of decision is made. We are talking about two batsmen with phenomenal Test records who have done it against Australia in the past and, with good players like that, you do not jettison them easily. Cook, for instance, will end up with one of the greatest of all England records and you have to give people of that calibre every possible chance to show they are worth a place. Jonathan Trott (left) and Alastair Cook head out to open England's second innings against West Indies . Trott walks past Cook after he was dismissed for just four runs by Jerome Taylor on day three . I said after the first day of this Test that England’s top order was a bit one-paced which could be an issue but that does not mean I think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline. England’s new opening pair have very different issues. Trott will have played all sorts of mind games with himself ahead of this game, telling himself to enjoy it and trying to forget how people perceive him after leaving Australia. He will have desperately tried not to build this Test up too much but, once out in the middle, he will have known how important it is. You could see how frenetic he was and how much he was moving at the crease. When you are nervous and desperate to do well your movements can become exaggerated as emotion takes hold. He has got to tell himself to stay still at the crease. The Trott I remember was almost Jacques Kallis-like in how still he was. If it were not for his scratching around you wouldn’t notice him. The Trott I remember would get to 70 before you knew it and we can’t judge his comeback on a Test where he has received good deliveries in both innings. Trott was making his first Test appearance for England in 18 months against the West Indies . He has to tell himself to calm down, stay still and chill a bit at the crease and it will be hard because the Duke ball is swinging and he is not accustomed to being an opener. He has been at three his whole career. If he does not make runs in the next two Tests and England are convinced he won’t be able to become the player he was then that is the time to have a look at someone else. Not now. The captain, in contrast, has a technical issue. Cook is mentally one of the strongest cricketers England have ever produced, an incredible fighter and an incredible bloke who has such a burning desire to prove people wrong. Trott leaves the field in Antigua following his poor showing on day three of the first Test . Yes, form is a concern — he hasn’t scored an international century in two years but this is a man who reached 25 Test hundreds in record time. And it is true to say he has been found out. Cook based his game around three shots — the cut, the pull and clip off the hip — and he would get lots of runs. Now opponents are bowling at him in the areas he doesn’t want them to and he has a problem when the ball is moving. But the swinging ball is not a new phenomenon, especially to an opener brought up in England, and Cook has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his Test career. Trott was very much in the mould of South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis (above) when he was on form . Cook has now gone 61 combined Test and ODI innings without making a century . West Indies will be very disciplined for an hour but their third seamer is Jason Holder. This is not Australia. If Cook can just sit in, be a bit more disciplined outside off stump and see off that new ball then the run-making opportunities will come. Bowlers will get bored before he does. It is not that he cannot score when the ball is pitched up. You don’t score 8,423 Test runs without being able to play off the front foot. Of course he can. But in his first 10 or 15 minutes he is pushing too hard at the ball rather than letting it come to him. These are both exceptional players and you are always a better player when you are out of a side. It takes a long time to make a Test player —don’t discard them until you are absolutely sure the time is right.", "summary": "Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott have both struggled with the bat .\nTrott looked nervous while his movement was erratic .\nCook hasn't scored an international century in two years ."}

The director and his companion, social welfare official Abimael Rodas Palacios, were riding in their pickup truck when suspected Mara Salvatrucha gang members opened fire . Cuyun had been riding to work before the sudden attack on Friday morning in Guatemala City, the nation's capital and largest city . Salvadoran Juan Carlos Medina Luna, 29, and Guatemalan Mario Alfonso Aguilar, 18, were arrested after a short police chase . Juan Carlos Medina Luna, 29, who entered the country from El Salvador two months ago, said he carried out the hit on the orders of a man named 'El Travieso' or 'The Naughty One' and did it 'because I like to kill'. Guatemalan Mario Alfonso Aguilar, 18, who is known as Marito, was also arrested for the attack on Friday after a police chase, according to Prensa Libre. Another suspect in the two men's car fled, police say. The incident reportedly stretched for several blocks after a gang truck pulled alongside Cuyun's pickup and began shooting. Cuyun and his companion Abimael Rodas Palacios were said to have gotten out of their car and began firing back at their attackers. Palacios, 42, a worker for the country's social welfare secretary, was taken to the hospital with bullet wounds in his leg and arm. Two AK-47s and two grenades were found inside Medina Luna and Aguilar's gray Mitsubishi van. Medina Luna said that the pair had been ordered to kill Cuyun by gang leader El Travieso, and said that he did the hit job because he enjoys killing .

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had to look away as disturbing footage of Tilly meowing in distress as he threw her against the door was played in Swindon Magistrates Court. He claimed he was 'accidentally' high on 'white rhino' - super-strength cannabis - and was being egged on by friends when the abuse occurred. Scroll down for video . Disturbing scenes: Defendant flushes Tilly's head in the toilet while high on super-strength cannabis . Tilly was held by her tail and dangled in bathwater. She was in such a sorry state when RSPCA inspectors found her that she had to be put to sleep. Inspectors said she suffered a lot in her short life . Owner Sarah Reeves was filmed throwing her cat against the walls, alerting the RSPCA to the abuse . The defendant admitted to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering and was given a nine-month referral order and banned for keeping animals for ten years. At an earlier hearing, Tilly's owner, Sarah Reeves, 19, was also given a ten-year ban from keeping animals. The RSPCA became aware of Tilly's condition when friends filmed Reeves throwing the young cat against the walls of her home, where the male had been living for a month, the court heard. RSPCA Inspector Miranda Albinson said when she arrived, the cat was cowering under a blanket, weighing just a third of what she should weigh, cold to the touch and 'clearly dying'. She said: 'This cat suffered a great deal in its very short life.' Tanya James, prosecuting the 16-year-old, told the court: 'The vet was asked to consider all the evidence in relation to this defendant, and in his opinion, it shows him subjecting the cat concerned to mental and physical suffering when he flushed her in the toilet. 'The cat was further distressed when it was forced to cling on to him (the defendant), and being dropped in the bath was a further traumatic experience. 'The cat would have been suffering considerable stress and anxiety throughout the incident. 'He states the cat was locked in the bathroom 24/7 and rarely got fed. 'He had been living at the address for a month, and said he had kicked the cat in the stomach in a play fight. 'He agreed he had been cruel to Tilly. 'On the day in question he had come back to the house and there was a group of males smoking weed and Sarah asked him to put Tilly in the bathroom.' Mark Glendenning, defending the youth, said: 'The cat suffered at the hands of the co-defendant which is why it had to be euthanised. 'He can give no credible explanation as to why this happened, other than he did not give it any thought, which is worrying in itself. 'There is some talk he will have to rely on food banks, and he was effectively sofa-surfing.' Linda Raine, Chair of the Bench, told the youth: 'This was a horrible incident.

{"document": "England had a good day on Tuesday at the start of this second Test in conditions that suited them. If they go on to bat themselves into a strong position, they can look at it in one of two ways. England can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here. If that’s the case then carry on as you are, but a position of strength is often a good one from which to take a long hard look at yourself and say ‘how can we improve?’ Alastair Cook needs something different to draw on in his same-same pace bowling attack . Cook is frustrated after dropping a catch off Marlon Samuel, who was on 32 and finished the day 94 not out . Cook and coach Peter Moores are under pressure to produce a result after drawing the first Test . The biggest reason England have not won away from home since 2012 is that they are lacking something different in their attack. The whole of England’s bowling psyche is about containment, it’s about bowling maidens and building pressure, as we saw for much of the first day here in Grenada until West Indies started to crack. That’s fine and it has been very successful for them but with so much batting depth now, with Jos Buttler arguably the best Test No 8 England have ever had, they can afford to pick someone who gives them an extra ingredient. There are those who feel it could have been provided here by Adil Rashid but by all accounts he hasn’t been bowling well enough to warrant selection. England have a good spinner in Moeen Ali - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back-up in Joe Root. So perhaps that trump card could come in place of one of the four seamers who all have similar attributes. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid could offer what is needed but by all accounts he hasn’t been bowling well enough . Cook speaks with paceman Mark Wood, who could be what is needed with comparisons to Simon Jones . The one I would keep an eye on is Mark Wood. From what I’ve seen of him there is a bit of Simon Jones about him and the Welshman was a key element of England’s best attack of the last 20 years - the 2005 Ashes line-up. Jones learnt a lot of the skills that made him the 2005 trump card on the Caribbean tour a year earlier, for instance the ability to gain skiddy reverse swing on flat pitches, and Wood might have done that now. I don’t like building players up before they have played Test cricket and then quickly passing judgment on them when they are given their chance but Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches. He is the sort of bowler who almost takes the pitch out of the equation - like Jones and like Darren Gough and perhaps Craig White from my day. Moeen Ali is a good spinner for England, even though he looked rusty after being recalled for Grenada . Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches on which England struggle . In England we don’t produce enough of that sort of bowler and when we do get one we can hold them back a bit because they can be considered a luxury, or too much of a gamble. Look at the championship game which has just finished at Chelmsford between Essex and Kent. Wickets fell cheaply to medium-paced seam bowlers like David Masters, Jesse Ryder and Darren Stevens. Players like that will never have the attributes to take wickets overseas for England. A bowler like Tymal Mills, a left-armer with real pace who moved on from Essex to Sussex last winter, might. But will he be trusted to form part of a county attack in English conditions? Ben Stokes was the pick of the bowlers for me on day one because of the fuller length that he bowled. I was a bit surprised at how ‘back of a length’ he was in Antigua because I’ve seen him play in county cricket, bowl full and reverse it. He was definitely searching for that fuller length. Ben Stokes, the pick of England's bowlers on day one, athletically fields a shot from  his own bowling . Umpire Steve Davis reprimands England's Ben Stokes after he exchanged words with Marlon Samuels . Yes, at times England bowled a bit short. It might have been a case of coming from Antigua, where it was certainly not a ‘hit the top of off stump’ pitch, to here four days later where they found conditions conducive to bowling. I would have done exactly the same as Alastair Cook and bowled first and even though England were not quite at their best wickets started to tumble. Yet you have to remember that conditions and pitches change during the course of a Test — Antigua swung for three days and then didn’t for the last two — and sides have to aspire to a balanced attack. This England attack might be good enough for Grenada on a day like Tuesday but they must seek that little bit more.", "summary": "West Indies were 188 for five at the close of play on day one in Grenada .\nConditions suited England at the start of the second Caribbean Test .\nEngland's biggest weakness is a lack of something different in their attack .\nMark Wood, who is in the Caribbean, could offer a new element .\nAlastair Cook's side hasn't won away from home since 2012 ."}

{"document": "He was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight, so when Costel Pantilimon conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst – for himself and the club’s top-flight status. That was four weeks ago when Aston Villa ran riot at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland were booed from the field at half-time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits. Within 48 hours Gus Poyet had been sacked and Dick Advocaat was being installed. The Dutch boss celebrated his first home match with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle last weekend, a result which moved the Black Cats three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon’s visit of Crystal Palace. Sunderland Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon celebrates Jermain Defoe's goal against Newcastle United . Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone - the man who was dropped in the wake of October’s 8-0 defeat at Southampton – and the Romanian stopper admits there has been a definite mood change under Advocaat. ‘Before the new manager came, our confidence was not in a good way,’ said the 28-year-old, who was a Premier League winner with Manchester City in 2012 and again last season. ‘We were playing very badly, but now we have a new motivation. He’s brought the enjoyment back. ‘I never expected to play in a game like the 4-0 loss at home to Aston Villa. I was upset. You start to think about what you did wrong. The former Manchester City goalkeeper celebrates with teammate Santiago Vergini at the Stadium of Light . ‘We had to change something. It wasn’t easy. I thought about relegation after the Villa game. ‘I was asking myself, “What is happening?”. We couldn’t win games at home. Away from home we were taking points, but in front of our fans we were failing. 'It was strange and very frustrating. I didn’t know what we could do to be better.’ The answer, it appears, was Advocaat. ‘He has tried to bring us together as a group,’ explained Pantilimon, who has so far avoided one of Advocaat’s infamous fines for a lack of punctuality. ‘We all eat lunch together as a team. That should be normal. It’s a good idea, it creates a stronger group. It means we get to know each other better and other people’s situations. Pantilimon rolls the ball out to a defender as Sunderland beat Newcastle at the Stadium of Light . ‘On the pitch, he wants us to be aggressive all the time, but also keep the ball a lot more. ‘Before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this. I think these words said everything, the motivation was at 100 per cent. ‘The atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after City won the league (in 2012). ‘It was incredible. My wife and my parents were there and they loved the game.’ Both of Pantilimon’s parents are deaf and the keeper uses sign language to communicate. Indeed, it was some advice from his father which set him on his way to a career between the posts. The Romanian shot-stopper celebrates a Sunderland win with his team-mates against Newcastle . ‘I was a striker when I started playing as a child because I liked scoring goals,’ said 6ft 8ins Pantilimon, who was raised in Bacau at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. ‘My father told me it was better to go in goal. He said I had the physical attributes to play there. ‘But I was not always so tall. I had a period between 14 and 16 when I grew so fast. ‘Thankfully, I didn’t like basketball so much. When I was about 15 I realised I could be a professional goalkeeper. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat enjoyed his first victory as manager in the derby game with Newcastle . ‘I was only 16 when I made my debut for a professional club. It was a third division club, but it was young to make my debut at that level. ‘I was always confident I could be a goalkeeper.

{"document": "This is the brilliant young honors student who was brutalized by Mad Men star Jon Hamm in a sadistic fraternity hazing ritual. Seen here for the first time, Mark Allen Sanders was beaten with a paddle, dragged around a room by his genitals and had his pants set on fire. Golden Globe winner Hamm was one of seven Sigma Nu brothers who tormented and humiliated Sanders when he was a young pledge at the University of Texas at Austin. The young man was hit so hard during the warped 1990 initiation that he suffered a fractured spine and nearly lost a kidney. Scroll down for video . Hazing hell: Today Mark Sanders is a doctor and lawyer in Fort Worth Texas. But after he graduated high school  in 1988 he entered the University of Texas at Austin and pledged the Sigma Nu fraternity. That's when he met John Hamm and his hazing hell began . Football hero: Jon Hamm the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin . Partners: Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt attended the \"Girls\" season four series premiere after party at The Museum of Natural History on January 5, 2015 in New York City. Sanders subsequently withdrew from the university and sought counselling to cope with the shameful episode which resulted in a police inquiry and the fraternity chapter being disbanded. Hamm, a sophomore, was identified as a ringleader and arrested in 1993, long before he became one of America's most recognizable actors playing boozy advertising exec Don Draper. An assault charge was dismissed, however, and he completed a period of probation instead of receiving a conviction for hazing. Our exclusive photos show Sanders in his senior year at Richland High School in North Richland Hills, Texas where he excelled in his studies, played for the basketball team and was treasurer of the school council. Despite his ordeal at UT he was able to resume his education at Texas Christian University, before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine. The 45-year-old lives now with his wife Anada, 41, and their two children in Fort Worth, where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury. He has declined to speak publicly about his ordeal but the harrowing details are laid bare in court documents dating back more than two decades. In a 1991 interview transcript obtained by Daily Mail Online, Sanders tells investigators with the Travis County's Attorney's Office how he suffered 'repeated beatings and assaults' at the hands of Sigma Nu 'actives'. He also alleged that he and his fellow pledges were subjected to 'repeated confinements' in a series of tiny compartments carved into the frat building's foundations - including 'the pit', 'the hole' and 'the grave'. Sanders listed Hamm as one of his chief tormentors, recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the 'bulls*** list' When Sanders forgot the last of Hamm's nicknames, which included MC Hammer and Young Bobby, he recalled how Hamm got \"mad, I mean really mad' Sanders told officials the worst of the hazing happened in the early hours of November 10, 1990 when he was summoned to the house and warned by Hamm: 'It’s going to be a long night.' The junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. Mark Sanders in his 1988 high school yearbook from Richland High School in North Richland Hills . He listed Hamm as one of his chief tormentors, recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the 'bulls*** list'. When he forgot the last of Hamm's nicknames, which included MC Hammer and Young Bobby, he recalled how Hamm got \"mad, I mean really mad'. Hamm and his frat cohorts' retribution was to spank Sanders repeatedly with a paddle. 'I'm hurting bad, I mean being hit right where the kidney is, it's killing me,' Sanders told his interviewers. Hamm and another fraternity member then lifted Sanders up by his underwear, pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion. 'I don't know how far underwear stretches, I don't know how far I was off the ground,' he recalled. 'I was hurting really bad and I remember I was looking up at the ceiling and I was gritting my teeth and squinting my eyes ... it was sawing and it was hurting.' Sanders told investigators how Hamm then led him to 'the pit' where he ordered him to do press-ups and pushed his face into the ground. The distraught pledge felt someone, possibly Hamm, standing on his back. Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to Sanders' pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, instead making him blow them out. Finally he was led upstairs to the 'party room' when Hamm hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his testicles and pulled him around the room 'for at least a minute'. Suave Don Draper has had to his own dark past on the hit show Mad Men. But for Jon Hamm, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident,' said a friend . Despite his ordeal, Sanders was able to resume his education at Texas Christian University, before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine. The 45-year-old lives now with his wife  in Fort Worth, where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury . In the wake of the hazing, Sanders fled to a friend's room to escape further brutality before eventually showing his bruises to fellow students. He later claimed to have suffered nerve damage to his ribs, kidney spasms and a lineal spinal fracture . Sanders' horrified mother Margaret reported it to UT authorities, triggering a police investigation and prompting the fraternity to permanently close its UT chapter. University records show Hamm, now aged 44, left the college at the end of the semester without a degree and returned to his hometown in Missouri. Sanders later launched a lawsuit against Sigma Nu seeking 'unspecified actual and exemplary damages for willful and wanton misconduct'. It was dismissed with the agreement of both parties, however, in 1993, possibly signalling that an out-of-court settlement had been reached. That same year Hamm was arrested by the Austin Police Department but court documents show that in 1995 he received deferred adjudication, allowing him to avoid a criminal conviction by serving a period of probation. His hazing shame went unreported for two decades until Star magazine broke the story last week in the midst of the final Mad Men season airing on AMC. Hamm is yet to comment but a friend told Star: 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to the pledge and beat him with a paddle . Early career: Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Three Sigma Nu members also pleaded no contest to charges of hazing, a misdemeanor, and were ordered to serve 15 to 30 days in jail.

{"document": "'Loneliness maps' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas' residents are most at risk. Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.", "summary": "Local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk .\nEssex and Gloucestershire have already made 'loneliness maps'\nExperts warn that being lonely can lead to serious health problems ."}
{"document": "Friends of a British backpacker who drowned during a diving trip on the Great Barrier Reef claim staff deleted photos that were taken shortly before the doomed young woman left the boat. Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time. Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances. While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted. The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it. British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays . 'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail. 'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she’s dead.' Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning. Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted. 'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote. The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted. Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell . The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned . Ms Farrell was on her first scuba diving trip when she tragically drowned near Blue Pearl Bay (pictured) 'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read. 'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.' Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life. 'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed. 'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued. This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia . Ms Farrell (not pictured) was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays . When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted. Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation. Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs. 'I don’t want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We’re heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail. The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell’s mother Caron, said at the time: ‘The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. ‘At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. ‘They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.’ The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell’s death are fully understood. Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17.

Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China – where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter’s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans – just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United’s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter – 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton’s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez’s side. Of the 10 Premier League clubs active on Weibo, six – United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, feature in the top 20 most followed clubs in China. The Manchester clubs are first and second, with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao – managed by Fabio Cannavaro – third and Barcelona fourth. Chelsea are 11th on the list of clubs with most followers on the Chinese microblogging site . Liverpool have 2.3million followers on Chinese site Weibo compared to 4.2million on Twitter . Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th – with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham – and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China – in December 2014 the China’s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum – expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world.

The authorities drove the naked, bloated corpses of the four alleged terrorists around the town in a pickup truck from the mortuary to Garissa Primary School. It comes as survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding in a wardrobe and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued after al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school . In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers . Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but they have not been named and their nationalities have not been revealed. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. 'I want to see them,' Muna Haji told The Washington Post. 'I want to know that these people are dead. They have killed innocent people.' Survivor Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue today. She was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148 .

People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa . This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre . Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen . Today survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued . The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a £145,000 bounty on his head. The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning today, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' al-Shabab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group.

'This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties. 'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation. 'Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,' he said in a televised speech.

{"document": "The baby boom generation is set to leave one last burden to its children and grandchildren – a wave of funeral debt. The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ A 'simple' funeral with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker now costs £3, 590 . Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.", "summary": "Number of deaths in Britain will increase by 20% over the next 20 years .\nFuneral firms are faced with bad debts and have increased their prices .\nA  funeral with a cremation, minister and an undertaker now costs £3,590 .\nYounger people may be straddled with 'funeral debts' due to higher fees ."}
{"document": "An eight-year-old boy from Layton, Utah, ran 33 miles just weeks before undergoing his fourth round of surgery on a malignant brain tumor. Lotatoa 'Lota' Ward just loves to run. Even before he was first diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumor - known as a mature Teratoma - back in October 2014, the young man was already running half marathons for charity, even raising $1,700 in September for two of his friends who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy. Though his diagnosis meant more time in the hospital, often in order to undergo some kind of surgical procedure, the tumor did nothing to stop Lota from hitting the trails. In fact, both he and his doctor say it has actually helped him through his treatments. 'I got this!' eight-year-old Lota Ward had already run several half marathons before being diagnosed with a brain tumor, and still continues to run despite his diagnosis . Most recently, Lota made the decision to attempt the 10th annual Antelope Island Buffalo Run just outside Salt Lake City, with the help of his running fanatic father. The 50-mile race was the eight-year-old's biggest challenge yet, but he tackled it like a trained professional, completing a total of 33 miles - longer than a full marathon - before his sore feet forced him to stop. 'I like running because it helps me a lot with hard times,' Lota told Runner's World. 'It doesn’t make me feel scared going into brain surgery.' In recovery: Lota underwent his fourth brain surgery on Wednesday, April 1, and while the Ward family remains optimistic, the fight is not over yet . 'I like running because it helps me a lot with hard times': Lota's hobby has become a source of strength for him in the face of several brain sugeries . Shortly after his diagnosis last October, Lota underwent two initial brain surgeries to help drain spinal fluid and to remove some of the tumor. However, due to the risk of stroke, doctor's were unable to complete the latter. Lota later went to see doctors for his three month check-up and was given devastating news: the tumor that they originally believed to be benign had grown aggressively. A subsequent biopsy lead to a new diagnosis - Lota has a Non-Germinomatous Germ-cell tumor, a malignant form of brain tumor. Luckily for the Ward family, the tumor was not untreatable. But Lota was going to be in for a fight. As tough as things became, however, Lota never stopped running. After every surgery, he would be up and walking within hours, ready to get out on the road once again. Reaching the peak: Lota was running before doctor's told him of his brain tumor. He had even ran a half marathon in aid of spinal muscular atrophy . Proud papa: Lota's father Keith Ward is also an avid runner and accompanied his son on the 50-mile race . Lota's parents were initially concerned, but their son's neurosurgeon, who also happens to be a trial runner, set their mind at ease. 'We asked [the doctor] if Lota’s running would affect the growth of the tumor or cause it to do mutations, and he said it doesn’t affect it at all,' Lota's father Keith told Runner's World. 'He said: \"As long as it keeps him happy and healthy, I don’t see anything wrong with it.\"' Lota is currently recovering from his fourth surgery and, according to his Facebook page, already has his next helf marathon scheduled for May 30. And though he didn't quite finish his most recent 50-mile race, the ever-positive little runner plans to take on a 100-mile race next year.", "summary": "Lotatoa 'Lota' Ward was diagnosed with a brain tumor in October 2014 .\nHe has since had to undergo four surgeries on his brain .\nJust before his latest surgery, Lota ran in the 10th annual Antelope Island Buffalo Run outside of Salt Lake City, Utah ."}
{"document": "Unexpected: Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year . Our glorious spring has accelerated the growing season - and supermarket shelves are already bursting with English summer fruit and veg. Usually at this time of year we would still be eating vegetables imported from Spain and South America. But thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual. Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year. It is stocking large Jack Hawkins, aromatic Red Choice and tiny Baby Plums, all grown in greenhouses across England. And the supermarket has been stocking asparagus since the beginning of the month. Strawberries are also already on the shelves - far earlier than normal - and English raspberries saw their earliest ever appearance in the last week of March. Morrisons, meanwhile, yesterday predicted Britain would have best crop of asparagus for nearly a decade. The chain estimates that the asparagus crop could be up 20 per cent this year compared to average, having received an early boost of high light levels and warm temperatures. Morrisons asparagus buyer David Bartle said: ‘Growing conditions look like they are going to be perfect. ‘The good weather will not only affect the amount of asparagus grown but also the quality of the crop. We could have the most exceptional year since 2007.’ Peter Cooke, Waitrose vegetable buyer, said: ‘Our customers can choose from a wide variety of home grown tomatoes and in bigger quantities than this time last year.’ The sunny spell is set to continue until later this week, when the weather will take a turn for the worst. The mercury is set to hit 21C (70F) as the Queen celebrates her 89th birthday today (Tuesday) - making it hotter than Ibiza, Athens and Barcelona.

She has been charged with second-degree assault and second-degree strangulation . Engelhardt refused to speak with McKenzie, telling her to first get a security pass. A fight then ensued. Authorities say the teacher was shoved against the wall, placed in a headlock and thrown to the floor. Several students also became involved in the attack, including McKenzie's 14-year-old niece. Another teacher was able to break up the melee and attend to Engelhardt. She was unconscious for several minutes and rushed to Winthrop University Hospital.

Speaking from her home to ABC 7, Engelhardt said she has long feared for her safety at the school. 'It's not like I thought a parent would do something, but I knew something violent was going to happen,' she told the network. 'I've warned (the school) time and again that the children have no respect for adults. 'Yes, I fear for my safety. They can't control the kids.' The attack was caught on the school's security cameras and the tapes were turned over to police. Police said they received the 911 call about 2 pm. McKenzie and her niece were arrested at the scene.

{"document": "More than 20,000 pupils passed ten or more GCSEs with either an A or an A* grade between 2009 and 2013, Department for Education statistics reveal . The number of teenagers getting straight As at GCSE has soared by a third in just five years, new figures show. More than 20,000 children passed ten or more with either an A or an A* grade, Department for Education statistics reveal. But critics say increasing numbers of high-fliers mean not enough has been done to stop qualifications becoming too easy. The latest figures show that one in 30 pupils who sat the exams ended up with at least ten A grades. In 2009, the number of students who managed to get straight As was 15,791. This rose to 16,983 in 2010, 18,468 in 2011 and 18,829 in 2012. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 20,307 received As across the board. The figures suggest Britain’s most able students are increasingly getting top marks in all subjects. GCSE grades are used by universities to decide who to admit to courses, along with personal statements and references. However, as a greater proportion of pupils is classified as excellent, it is harder for top universities such as Oxford and Cambridge to identify truly exceptional youngsters. And while British results appear to be improving for some pupils, the country is slipping behind other nations when measured using international tests. Results published just over a year ago showed British teenagers dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. Tests on more than half a million pupils worldwide found those in Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland had a much better command of core subjects. Children in the Chinese city of Shanghai were three years ahead of their British counterparts by 15. Overall, the UK came 26th out of 65 countries and economic regions in the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Christopher McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘Sadly, grade inflation has devalued GCSEs to such an extent that any pass below a B has become little more than a certificate of incompetence. Critics say increasing numbers of high-fliers mean not enough has been done to stop qualifications becoming too easy. GCSE grades are used by universities to decide who to admit to courses (file picture) ‘International comparisons of educational attainment, very serious concerns expressed by employers and the fact that many universities now have to put on remedial catch-up courses for new undergraduates, all point to a disastrous dumbing down of standards.’ The Coalition tried to halt grade inflation by making qualifications more rigorous, but many reforms are still being implemented. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Importantly, while overall results are up, the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and peers is closing.’ Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that teenagers applying to university had their details wrongly passed to advertisers, the data protection watchdog ruled yesterday. The university admissions service UCAS broke the law by signing youngsters up to receive adverts about mobile phones, energy drinks and other products. The practice earned UCAS more than £12million in a year, but, the Information Commissioner’s Office found it broke marketing rules and told it to change its procedures.", "summary": "More than 20,000 passed ten or more GCSEs with A or A* in last five years .\nOne in 30 children who sat the exams ended up with at least ten A grades .\nFigures suggest UK's most able pupils are increasingly getting top marks ."}
{"document": "Washington (CNN)Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with Justice Anthony Kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court's pivotal vote. Chief Justice John Roberts -- who shocked conservatives with his swing vote to uphold Obamacare -- this time seemed to lean more closely to conservative justices. The arguments unfurled inside a packed courtroom on Tuesday while supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage rallied outside -- with one protester even interrupting the arguments from within. RELATED: How a Cincinnati judge could shape the gay marriage case . Many questions on Tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system. All eyes were on Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered a key vote for challengers to the state bans, who has penned three decisions in favor of gay rights over the years. At the start of arguments he joined other conservatives concerned with the fact that  marriage has been defined between a man and a woman for a long time. \"This definition has been with us for millennia,\" he said. \"And it's very difficult for the court to say: 'Oh, well, we know better.' \" But later Kennedy pressed John Bursch, a lawyer defending the bans: \"Same sex couples say: 'Of course, we understand the nobility and the sacredness of the marriage. We know we can't procreate, but we want the other attributes of it in order to show that we, too, have a dignity that can be fulfilled.' \" Kennedy also said that Bursch's assertion \"that only opposite-sex couples can have a bonding with the child\" was \"just a wrong premise.\" When Bursch said the rate of out-of-wedlock birth has gone up in the country, Kennedy noted that if Bursch were to prevail, it might be difficult for same-sex couples to \"adopt some of these children.\" \"I think,\" Kennedy said, \"the argument cuts quite against you.\" He also brought up the fact that marriage \"bestows dignity.\" \"These parties say they want to have that same ennoblement,\" he said. Chief Justice John Roberts was also concerned with the traditional definition of marriage. He said this to Mary L. Bonauto, an attorney representing the challengers: \"You're not seeking to join the institution, you're seeking to change what the institution is.\" He expressed concern about closing off the debate currently going on in the states. \"I mean, closing of debate can close minds, and it will have a consequence on how this new institution is accepted.\" \"People feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it, than if it's imposed on them by the courts,\" he said. Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito were sharply critical in their questioning of Bonauto. Scalia said that the issue is not whether there should be same-sex marriage, \"but who should decide the point.\" Alito brought up how long marriage has been considered between a man and a woman and cast doubt that such a definition was meant to demean same-sex couples. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and other liberals seemed supportive of the challengers. When Bursch said that the issue should not be decided by the courts,  Sotomayor pushed back. \"I suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that there's some gay people who will choose not to. ... Just as there are some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. So we're not taking anybody's liberty away.\" Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at American University and CNN analyst, said Tuesday's session revealed few surprises to close observers of the court who expected Kennedy and Roberts would be the swing votes on this case. RELATED: John Roberts' big moment: Will he anger conservatives again? \"We heard both of them in the arguments today showing support for both sides of the argument, showing skepticism for both sides of the argument,\" Vladeck said. \"I think the headline here is it's about what we expected. It's going to be close, it's going to be divisive and it's going to come down to Kennedy and Roberts.\" Vladeck also cautioned against reading too much into the justices' questioning and comments during the oral arguments, which account for just a few hours in the multi-month process of deciding such an consequential case. The emotion of the case also flooded into the courtroom, as one protester seated inside began shouted and screaming in the middle of the arguments. \"If you support gay marriage you will burn in hell,\" the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream. RELATED: Meet the lawyers who will argue the gay marriage case . \"Rather refreshing actually,\" conservative Justice Antonin Scalia quipped as the man was dragged out to laughter in the courtroom. Lawyers with the pro-gay marriage organization Lambda Legal, which represented two of the cases wrapped into the Supreme Court case \"an awe-inspiring and singular moment in the march towards justice.\" \"It was incredibly moving to gather in the Supreme Court chamber with their parents and all 30 plaintiffs in these historic cases.   Mary and Doug were fantastic, making a compelling and to my mind irrefutable case on their behalf,\" Lambda Legal's Alphonse Gerhardstein said of the lawyers who argued in favor of same-sex marriage before the court on Tuesday. U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who represented the Obama administration's views, also presented arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, focusing on equal protection under the 14th amendment and likening bans on same-sex marriage to handing second-class status to gay Americans. \"I don't know why we would repeat history,\" he said.", "summary": "Questions Tuesday centered on whether defining marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by  judicial system .\nChief Justice John Roberts, who shocked conservatives with his swing vote to uphold Obamacare, seemed to lean conservative .\nEyes on Justice Anthony Kennedy, a key vote for challengers to the state bans, who has penned decisions in favor of gay rights ."}

Tourist police officers Samuel Kvarzell, Markus Asberg, Eric Jansberger and Erik Naslund halted a fight between two homeless men on the Uptown 6 train this Wednesday. A video of the selfless act then surfaced and has spread on social media, gaining them attention from hoards of fans, both male and female. Officials from the United States and Sweden have praised their brave efforts and they are set to return home as heroes. Scroll down for video . Giving thanks: New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton (center) thanked four Swedish cops who broke up a subway fight in The Big Apple this week . 'I would like to acknowledge them. There’s been a lot of attention paid to them, appropriately so, over the last day or so: a New York Post story and some other coverage,' Bratton said on Friday. 'Gentlemen, thank you very, very much. You did a great honor to yourselves, certainly to your police service and to your country. We appreciate all the help we can get,' he said. 'Here as tourists, they stepped up,' he added. The New York Post reports that the techniques employed by the Swedish men are in line with what the NYPD teaches their police officers. The physical force they employed is not intended to hurt the individual they are restraining and is still very effective. 'I was noticing that the moves that they made are very much the same moves that we now teach our young people at the academy in terms of how to take people down in a way trying to ensure that they’re not injured during that apprehension,' Bratton said with pride. Bratton presented the men with medallions. When the four men return to Sweden they will be awarded at a lunch with Sweden's minister for home affairs Anders Ygema. 'The minister has invited the police officers to the government office for lunch once they get back to Sweden,' spokesman Fredrik Persson said. Earlier this week officer Asberg said what he and his friends did was 'no big deal.' Bratton disagrees with him and commends their actions. '[They] found themselves involved a situation on the subway where they activated themselves as police officers,' Bratton said. '‎We very much appreciate that,' he said. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty . The Swedish friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway on Wednesday, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post. Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight . The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene . The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Misérables.

{"document": "A Los Angeles judge agreed with the governor's decision to reject parole for a Charles Manson follower imprisoned 43 years for two brutal murders. Bruce Davis' record shows there is 'some evidence' he is dangerous and shouldn't be freed, Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan wrote in a decision filed Wednesday. Davis, 72, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea and sentenced to life in prison in 1972. He was 30 years old at the time. Then and now: Bruce Davis, Charles Manson's former follower (pictured left in 1970 and right in March 2014), has been denied parole after spending 43 years in prison for a double homicide in 1969 . Bloodthirsty: Bruce Davis held Gary Hinman, a friend, at gunpoint while Charles Manson (pictured) sliced his face open with a sword . Davis, who once bragged of cutting Shea's head off, claimed he has turned his life around in prison, earning a doctoral degree in philosophy, becoming religious and ministering to other inmates. He also married a woman he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. The couple recently divorced. The parole board cited those accomplishments, along with his age and good behavior as reasons to grant him parole in March last year. Gov. Jerry Brown rejected that decision in August, saying factors in his favor were outweighed by the brutality of the killings and Davis' lack of insight into the crimes, which he didn't admit until 2012 after claiming for years to be an innocent bystander. The Manson family planned to rob Hinman, a friend, but killed him after holding him two days because he said he didn't have money. Davis held Hinman at gunpoint while Manson sliced his face open with a sword. About a month later, Davis stabbed Shea, who worked at Spahn Ranch where the family lived. His body was found buried on the property years later. Homicidal maniac: Charles Manson, pictured left in 2011, orchestrated the murders of eight people in 1969, including actress Sharon Tate (right). Davis did not play a part in her slaying . 'Both victims were abused, defiled and mutilated,' Ryan wrote. 'These actions demonstrate the utmost callous disregard for human suffering.' The judge said he gave broad deference to Brown's discretion and that the governor's decision in August didn't amount to cruel or unusual punishment. Davis' lawyer had not seen the decision, but said he would appeal to a higher court. 'I'm stunned. I can't believe he would do that,' attorney Michael Evan Beckman said. 'The judge is wrong.' The parole board has found Davis suitable for release three times, but Brown and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reversed the decision each time. Steve Grogan, another participant in those murders, was released many years ago after he agreed to lead police to where the bodies were buried on a remote movie ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Captured: Steve Grogan (left) and Bruce Davis (right) enter court to be tried for murder in 1970 . Brainwashed: Manson family murderers Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Leslie van Houton . Davis was not involved in the notorious killings of actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, and six others and was considered a better candidate for release. Manson and three followers, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles 'Tex' Watson, remain in prison for life in the Tate killings.

{"document": "(CNN)A Florida judge denied a motion by two women to join a lawsuit against Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer that alleged  underage sex crimes. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.", "summary": "Judge also throws out bombshell sex claims against lawyer Alan Dershowitz .\nHe asks a federal court to \"strike\" sex-related allegations against him .\nA court filing says Dershowitz had sex with minors via Jeffrey Epstein; he denies it ."}
{"document": "Amid the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, liberated by the British Army 70 years ago this week, love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her SS guards. But the love between British soldier, Sergeant Norman Turgel, 24 at the time, and teenage Polish girl Gena, 20, was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp's British commander Major Leonard Berney. This week survivors and liberators of the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany gathered to commemorate the day British soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible. Gena and Norman were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years, pictured before his passing in 1995 . Norman Turgel pictured as a young soldier in the British Intelligence Corps in his early 20s (l) and Gena Turgel as a young girl (r) Gena, weighing only a few pounds was, like many others in the camp, a walking skeleton, for whom certain death was only days away. Among the recently dead was Dutch girl Anne Frank whose diaries while hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam became world renowned. But through the striped and filthy prison uniform, Sergeant Norman Turgel of the 53 Field Security section of British Intelligence Corps, spotted an eternal beauty and began talking to her. Before long Norman had fallen in love with the young Jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again. Anne Frank, whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the Nazis became the defining account of the Holocaust, was just one of Bergen-Belsen's many victims. Frank was living in the Netherlands when the Nazis seized it in 1940, leaving them trapped. In 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside Otto Frank's office building. They spent two years there, but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps. Anne, and her sister Margot, were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February 1945, just months before the Allies liberated it. Bergen-Belsen's SS commandant, the cruel and tyrannical Joseph Kramer, was among those Norman helped to round up and capture. Other soldiers helped hand out fresh bread and fruit. Norman became so besotted with Gena that he told her he was going to marry her one day. But here the story could have ended had it not been for Major Leonard Berney, the new commanding officer of what became Belsen Camp for Displaced Persons. With Norman posted away and other prisoners being repatriated to all parts of Europe, there was a danger of the young lovers being parted forever. Major Leonard Berney, who is now 95, was the commanding officer of liberated Belsen. He played cupid for soldier Norman  and Gena. Pictured in uniform (l) and more recently (r) Bergen Belsen was located in northern Germany, south-west of the town of Bergen itself. From 1941 ro 1945 almost 50,000 people were killed there along with 20,000 Soviet inmates . The Camp was liberated on 15 April 1945 by the British 11th Armoured Division and soldiers discovered roughly 60,000 starved, and ill prisoners inside. 13,000 unburied corpses littered the ground around the camp when they arrived . When the Allies arrived at Bergen-Belsen, it was in the grip of a terrible typhus outbreak, with prisoners dying at a rate of 500 a day. A sombre sign erected by the British Army, and photographed by Mr Parsons, documents at least part of that grisly death tool, revealing that 13,000 people perished even after troops came to their aid. Shortly after the camp was liberated by British and Canadian troops in 1945, it was torched, and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings, along with the Reichskriegs flag and Hitler portrait which adorned them, were consumed by flames. Major Berney, now 95 and living in retirement, took a personal interest in their unlikely romance, making sure messages to each other reached their destination in the chaos of the post-liberation activity. Major Berney wrote about his experiences in 'Liberating Belsen Concentration Camp' and gave evidence at the Belsen war crimes trials. His son, John Wood said: 'My father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions. Without him, they might well have lost touch.' Historic: As a crowd of people watch on, British troops burn the buildings to the ground . Horrific: Around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the Allies arrived . The camp, which became the final resting place of 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and those with disabilities, is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . Once Gena had been released from her living hell and been restored to health, Norman and she married and started lived in London. They went on to have three children, Hilary 68, Bernice, 63, and Harris 62, eight grandchildren and 12 great grand children. Norman died in 1995, two months short of their golden wedding anniversary. He passed away a few years ago but Gena was prominent this week in the anniversary of Belsen's liberation. Gena at a book launch with Major Berney's son, John Wood, who said: 'My father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions' She said: 'Today it is hard to imagine what it was like in the camp, people so thin and so defeated that it was hard to tell if they were men or women. 'I spent many days with Anne Frank. She was a beautiful, sweet girl but she got ill and I was with her to almost the last. She gazed into the distance as the days went by and I could tell she had gone. 'I was lucky and for that I can thank Major Berney. He was a wonderful man and made sure that Norman and I kept our romance alive in the most testing conditions. 'We had him to thank for a wonderful marriage and for coming together at a time when it would have been easy to have lost touch.'

Half a million first time buyers will be helped onto the housing ladder every year by 2020, George Osborne pledged today. The Chancellor said he wanted a 1980s-style property 'revolution' after years of declining home ownership. He pledged to double the number of people buying their first home using government help-to-by schemes. Since 2010 there have been 1.2 million first-time purchases and Mr Osborne wants at least 2.4 million more over the next five years. Mr Osborne said he wanted to reverse the 'steady' decline in first-time buyers getting a home. He told Sky News: 'I'm a great believer in a home-owning nation; a home-owning democracy where families can get on the housing ladder. 'And the truth is that the number of first-time buyers has fallen steadily over recent years, and I want to reverse that, and I want to help families get on that housing ladder.' David Cameron added: 'We have acted on every front, we’ll continue to do so. We have reformed the planning system so that we can build houses. 'We have help to buy, which has helped thousands of young people onto the housing ladder. 'With the help to buy ISA, a new scheme that will help people save for a deposit. 'So we’re building the homes, we’re helping young people, we are creating an economy with jobs, we want to see a doubling in the number of first-time buyers. I believe Britain should be a home-owning democracy, that’s the goal.' It came after Mr Osborne told the Sunday Telegraph that he wanted a 'massive increase in the number of people who can own their own home'. He said: 'Home ownership is an absolutely core Conservative belief and aspiration that we support. 'In the next parliament I would like to see over a million more people helped into home ownership by a Conservative government. 'I would like to see us double the number of first-time buyers up to half a million. That is the kind of level we saw in the 1980s. 'There is no reason why our country can't achieve that again.

'Under this Tory-led government we've seen the lowest levels of housebuilding in peacetime since the 1920s and home ownership has fallen to a 30-year low. 'Labour's Better Plan will ensure Britain builds the homes working people need.

{"document": "The family of the seven-year-old British boy killed in the French Alps say his death has left a ‘vast void in their hearts’. Carwyn Scott-Howell was described as a ‘daring, outgoing and determined’ youngster whose ‘handsome smile lit up any room’. The schoolboy was skiing with his family when he became separated from his mother and headed into dense woodland where he fell over a 164ft drop. Tragedy: Carwyn Scott-Howell (left; right) fell to his death while on  holiday with his mother Ceri, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19, in the Alps . Footprints in the snow eventually led police to his body, investigators revealed last night. They also described how the boy’s mother Cari, 44, desperately tried to find her missing son. In a moving tribute, Carwyn’s family described how he ‘made life full of laughter with never a dull moment’. ‘Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky,’ they added. ‘Carwyn was an adorable, caring person who gave so much love. The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts.’ Carwyn, from Talybont-on-Usk in Wales, was said to have been a ‘very competent skier and snowboarder’ who had started skiing at the age of three. The family said they had spent ‘the most happy ski holiday together’ in the resort of Flaine in the days before the tragedy stuck. They were enjoying their last run of the day when the boy’s sister Antonia, nine, lost her ski on a jump and Carwyn pressed on ahead. His mother stopped to help her daughter and continued to the bottom of the piste. But Carwyn – who modelled himself on the TV adventurer Bear Grylls – was nowhere to be seen. Mrs Scott-Howell returned to their hotel believing her son had made his own way back, but returned to the mountain when she found he wasn’t there. Pierre-Yves Michau, the judge heading the investigation, said yesterday: ‘She asked everyone if they had seen him.’ It is believed Carwyn left the piste and entered woodland because he had spotted the resort through the trees. Taking off his skis, he continued on foot as he hurried to get there. Police chief Michel Ollagnon confirmed that officers had been led to the boy’s body by footprints in the snow. He said the final steps were broken up by ‘sliding marks’ where Carwyn had tackled the sharper inclines on his backside.

Mr Ollagnon said: ‘We think he was attracted by the ski station that he could see below. We think he was heading for the resort.’ Police last night said Carwyn’s body is ready to be repatriated but his family remained in the Alps. Back in Wales, his friends have written in a condolence book on display at Brecon Cathedral: ‘Miss you in class. Miss you at playtime. We will miss you always.’ Alongside the book is a picture of Carwyn dressed in his karate kit.

{"document": "MaiquetIa, Venezuela: it's a long way from Bundoran — and a long way from the Belfast homes of Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan. The pair mischievously claimed that Donegal's seaside town was their destination of choice for a post-Olympic break following their respective bronze medal wins at London 2012, but they have certainly travelled far and wide during the current Olympiad. Barnes may have already been well known in Ireland prior to their achievements in London, but taking up his part in a charming double act with Conlan only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights. Conlan (leff) lands a right jab on Matthew Martin during his bantamweight bout in Glasgow in 2014 . The reality of making that happen is far more complex, of course, and the efforts of Barnes and Conlan to make it to Rio 2016 are unprecedented. On Saturday night, the Belfast boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer's Olympic Games, with Barnes needing to ensure victory while Conlan must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere. Their mission takes them to Maiquetia, northern Venezuela, where they will take on native opposition, the latest stop on the road-trip that is the World Series of Boxing (WSB) — a part of the convoluted new structure that once was 'amateur' boxing. WSB boxers are part of a franchise team, fighting individually over five three-minute rounds in a pro-style format. Barnes and Conlan box for the Italia Thunder team, but the sights and sounds of Milan and Rome were not what drew them to the competition. In fact, they have fought only three of their six bouts so far in Italy and while most WSB fighters receive payment, the Irish pair signed up with Olympic qualification as their sole motivation. Upon their return to Belfast after Saturday night's fight, they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips. That is the equivalent of three trips from Dublin to Melbourne. They will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and, as of today, Barnes has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to Conlan's 28. They are burnt out, peeved off and ready for rest — but only once their mission is complete Saturday night. Barnes is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in Rio . 'I just feel tired, I'm sick of it,' laments a worn-out Barnes, who is an undefeated 6-0. 'To fight every fortnight, travelling around the world, it's doing my head clean in. I'll be glad to get out of it. Hopefully I qualify and some good will have come from it. 'I was flying to Kazakhstan and I felt like crying on the plane, I felt like pulling out. I was very, very close. I think I was in Heathrow and I was going to get a plane back to Belfast. 'If I didn't qualify for the Olympics through this WSB, I'd have nothing to do with it. I've been training from November right through and then I'd need to go to the Europeans [Games] in June — I couldn't do that, like. I physically couldn't do that, it'd be impossible.' In addition to hand injuries, which have severely limited his training, Barnes has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first Irish boxer ever to reach a third Olympic Games. 'I hate flying, I just hate it, it depresses me even thinking about it. I can't even sleep, I'm that scared. I can't sleep, can't watch films, can't read books, I'm just too panicky, too nervous. 'I'll not even be able to drink water, never mind a beer to relax, because I'll be making weight.' If he sounds like a touch grouchy, it is understandable. While their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as Guba in Azerbaijan, Palermo, Poland's Konin, Almaty in Kazakhstan, Rome, Milan and now Maiquetia, the two-time Olympic medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities. 'Far from it,' says Barnes. 'You go away and you have to go to the worst areas, there's nothing extravagant about it. It's not five star — it's one-and-a-half star. 'You can't really see too much because we're only there for a short period of time and when we get there we're training to make the weight… We're home the next day [after the fight] in the early hours. So we're more or less in and out.' Michael Conlan (left) and Paddy Barnes sport their bronze medals following their success at London 2012 . Adding to Barnes' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light-flyweight limit. The 28-year-old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh-in demeanour are common, with Conlan witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room-mate. 'It does make it easier because we're mates outside boxing,' says Barnes of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal. 'We're travelling together and fighting together so it is good, I'd rather that then going away on my own because I think I'd pack it in. It's too much of a strain. 'But when we're away, I barely talk to him because he knows I'm making weight!' Conlan, the laidback member of the double act, takes a far more carefree approach to travel. 'Getting on a plane doesn't bother me, if you're going to die on a plane, you're going to die,' laughs Conlan. 'A lot of the flights I try and sleep through so I'll be waking up in their [local] time.' The 23-year-old recently became a father, with his young daughter just four weeks old, while Barnes is also a father to a daughter of 11 months. The pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since Conlan emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend's presence on WSB duty. 'It's good for both of us because I know when I'm training with him, we're both training hard and pushing each other,' says Conlan. 'Everything we've done up until this WSB since 2012 has been the exact same — Olympic bronze, European silver, Commonwealth gold. The fact that this WSB has messed me up a bit is a bit unfortunate but we're still going well,' adds Conlan, who is in qualification limbo after two disputed 'away' points decisions, increasing the temptation to turn pro . 'Winning [tonight] isn't going to be a problem, I'm just waiting on other results. It's a bit of a sickener, but it has to be done at the end of the day. I have to get in there and do what I have to do and win, do my part of the job.' 'I'll try not to make any dramatic decisions after the fight if it goes against me, but I have a sharp tongue at times and say stupid things,' says Conlan. 'Hopefully it all works out. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.' For Barnes, he maintains: 'The Olympic Games is what it's all about, it's every amateur boxer's dream and if I qualify, I'll be honoured to say I qualified for my third Olympic Games.'", "summary": "Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan are competing in Maiquetia, northern Venezuela on Saturday night .\nThe duo are hoping to qualify for the 2016 games in Rio .\nBarnes and Conlan box for the Italia Thunder team ."}

Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down.

Campbell posed for a photograph with his face coloured white alongside the caption, 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.' And on launching the campaign, Harewood said: 'What it brilliantly illustrates is that if you don't register to vote, you are quite literally taking all the vibrancy we have in our community off the table . 'If you don't register to vote, politicians don't really care about you, politicians aren't really caring about what you have to say, what you have to do, anything.

{"document": "The handsome Italian maths teacher who has taken the internet by storm for being the perfect mix of beauty and brains has spoken out about his new-found fame. Pietro Boselli, 26, originally from Brescia, Italy, says that he originally tried to keep his modelling a secret from his colleagues at the University College London (UCL) where he taught for fear they might 'look down on him'. In an interview with the Times, Boselli, an advanced maths lecturer with a PHD, said that when he was trying to establish himself as a teacher, he didn't want to include his work for fashion companies such as Abercrombie and Fitch on his CV and was less than proud of his alternative career. Scroll down for video . Not your average teacher: Wearing a tiny pair of green shorts, 26-year-old advanced maths teacher Pietro Boselli admits he tried to keep his double life as a model a secret from colleagues and students at UCL . The Italian model, whose looks have seen him amass a following of nearly half a million users on Instagram, isn't afraid to whip off his shirt to show his hard-earned muscles, pictured above with 'lifelong friend' Carmelo . More than just a pretty face: The lecturer has now achieved his PHD and is hoping to earn enough money from modelling to set up his own engineering consultancy . He told the newspaper he didn't want students in his classroom or his teaching peers to know, saying: 'I think, in a way, I was ashamed. I thought people in academia would look down on me.' Growing up in Italy, the young Boselli was scouted by Armani Junior which started off a double life of studying hard for his exams and posing in front of the lens whenever he could. He calls himself a 'nerd' and says that his studies were his priority growing up, forcing him to turn down lucrative jobs that would take him away from his books. His students at UCL, where he taught while studying for his PHD, did eventually discover the fitness fanatic's secret, after Googling him. When one maths student, Arief Azli, discovered his 6ft 1in lecturer's Instagram account, which has now amassed more than 480,000 followers, and has plenty of images of him in varying states of undress, he tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model.' Azil posted a picture of his lecturer scribbling equations on the whiteboard next to one of him shirtless with the caption: 'Only at UCL‬ ‪#‎MechanicalEngineers‬ ‪#‎ModellingandAnalysis ‪#‎Bromance‬.' Other students soon followed suit and posted pictures of him taking classes, with one saying: 'This is why I never miss a class'. Boselli says he knew his students had cottoned on when they started to take 'sneaky' images of him while he was at the front of the lecture hall. Cycling in the sea? He must be clever! Pietro says he trains once or twice a day to keep fit and is proud to show of his amazing body . A gruelling exercise regime keeps the model in tip-top condition: Pietro posted this image of a recent rock-climbing expedition on his Instagram account . Huge following: Pietro, pictured centre right with friends on a recent trip to Brooklyn, has now finished his stint as an advanced maths teacher at UCL (right) to concentrate on being a full-time model . Now the secret's out, the model, who has signed for top agency Models 1, says he's not worried about them seeing him posing topless. 'People ask me \"why are you topless in pictures? Why don’t you have any clothes on?\" But training is a big part of my life. 'I started going to the gym when I moved to London and, like everything I do, I’m very focused. I train once or twice a day and I’m happy to get recognition for having a good physique.' Boselli has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and is hoping that the money he earns from modelling will help him to establish his own engineering company in London. And the bad news for all those currently brushing up on their algebra? He's got a girlfriend. Although the model won't be drawn on her identity and there is little sign of her on his Instagram account, he has confirmed that he is off the market. The fashion model posted this picture on his Instagram account with a caption 'post-workout selfie' He describes himself as 'addicted to training' and said he works out at least two or three times a day . One of his students, Arief Azli tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model' Pietro's academic achievements are easily as impressive as his six-pack. He was awarded the Undergraduate Faculty Excellence Scholarship for the most outstanding academic achievement in his first year at UCL, before going on to get first-class honours. The fashion model was discovered at the age of six by renowned designer Giorgio Armani who saw potential and said he should be a model. His Instagram account gives an insight into his fitness regime as he posted a picture of himself in the pool, saying: 'Boosts circulation, gets metabolism up to speed and strengthens immune system!' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency'. In an interview with F Tape he said he would be concentrating on 'engineering, teaching maths and personal training' if he was not modelling. He posted a picture of his washboard abs on his Instagram, saying: 'Lying in bed.. My point of view' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency' He also revealed that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oscar Wilde and The Rolling Stones were among his idols.

'But I had to earn my points. I had to fight for everything that I got tonight on the court, because he wasn't going to give it to me. I knew that coming onto the court. 'I knew that he's a great competitor, that he grinds a lot, runs, and makes you play always an extra shot. That's why he's been top-10 player for so many years and he's tough to beat.' John Isner is up next for Djokovic after the American made it back-to-back wins over top-10 opponents. Hot on the heels of Tuesday's gruelling three-set triumph over Milos Raonic, the world number 24 had a more straight forward evening against fourth seed Kei Nishikori, winning 6-4 6-3.

{"document": "(CNN)An Arizona police chief on Wednesday supported an officer's decision to drive his car into an armed suspect, saying that although the move could have killed the suspect, deadly force was justified. Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. \"As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,\" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. \"And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,\" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. \"My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,\" she said. \"It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back.\" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

{"document": "The number of passenger vehicle teen drivers involved in U.S. fatal crashes decreased from 5,724 to 2,568, per 100,000 people in the last decade . The number of fatal crashes involving teenage drivers has dropped 55 per cent in the past decade, according to a U.S. report. Between 2004 and 2013, the number of passenger vehicle drivers aged 16 to 19 involved in U.S. fatal crashes decreased from 5,724 to 2,568, per 100,000 people. New safety features in cars and graduate license restrictions are among the top reasons for the dramatic drop in fatalities. Ruth Shults, an injury prevention researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta who worked on the report, said graduated licenses decrease overall crash rate in teen drivers by 20 to 40 per cent. Graduated licenses can put curfews on young drivers, putting less teens on the road at night. These types of licenses can also restrict the number of passengers a new driver can have in their car, according to Autoblog. Some states limit young drivers to one passenger, while others only allow relatives and driving instructors. As for time restrictions, some states, such as Idaho, do not let young drivers on the road from sunset to sunrise. Other states have more concrete time periods, such as 11pm to 5am or 12am to 6am. The age in which graduated licenses change from beginner to intermediate to fully privileged driver also varies among states. Eric Teoh, a senior highway statistician at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Virginia, who was not involved in the study said younger teens might not be getting behind the wheel, which means less accidents can occur. On average, three out of four U.S. high schools students aged 16 or older reported to have driven in the past 30 days when taking a survey . 'An 18-year-old novice is probably more prepared maturity-wise than a 16-year-old novice,' he told Autoblog. Three out four U.S. high schools students aged 16 or older had driven at least once during the 30 days before a survey was taken by the CDC, according to the report that announced the fatality information. The report looked at students in 42 states - California, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington were not included. The percentage of students who drove was higher in Midwestern and mountain states, and it was found to be lower in metropolitan areas.", "summary": "Between 2004 and 2013, number of passenger vehicle drivers aged 16 to 19 involved in U.S. fatal crashes decreased from 5,724 to 2,568, per 100,000 .\nNew safety features in cars and graduate licenses are among the reasons for the drop in fatalities .\nGraduated licenses decrease crash rate in teen drivers by 20 to 40 per cent .\nThree quarters of high school students aged 16 or older are on the road ."}

A mother-of-two branded 'Fagin' made almost £50,000 in a lucrative family shoplifting firm with her daughters - and now they have been told to pay back just £1 each. Dawn Bainbridge, 47, of West Rainton, County Durham, led a 'family business' that saw her and her two daughters steal thousands  of pounds worth of clothes from high street stores across the North and sell them online through Facebook. Their company 'Designer Goods North East' took more than £7,000 in online payments in just four months, had detailed sales records and even a debters' book. In a note seized by police, one daughter boasted of making £100 a week and said she dreamed of going it alone. At Newcastle Crown Court last year Judge Sean Morris jailed Bainbridge for 30 months, her daughter Claire Bainbridge, 21, for 20 months and other daughter Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, to 16 months behind bars. The mother, who is still serving her sentence, and two daughters, who have since been released, were back in court today for a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Prosecutor Bridie Smurthwaite told the court the mother made £15,017, Claire made £26,180 and Caitlyn made £7,476 from their illegal enterprise. The court heard none of the women have any assets that can be seized or sold so they were ordered to pay back just £1 each. Miss Smurthwaite told the court: 'There are confiscation orders in the sum of £1, that sum to be paid within 28 days.' The mother was allowed 56 days to pay back her £1 as she is the only one still in custody. The women face up to seven days behind bars if they fail to pay the £1 each on time. Claire Bainbridge, 21, (pictured left) and sister Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, (right) were both ordered to pay £1 each . During sentencing last year the judge slammed Bainbridge's parenting. The judge told the women: 'This was a professional, criminal family firm. 'Thousands and thousands of pounds worth of goods were taken in professional, planned shoplifting expeditions and professionally marketed by you on your own Paypal account and with money being withdrawn to distribute amongst the directors of the firm. 'People seem to think shoplifting doesn't matter. Well it does. 'The outlay shops have to provide: security machines, security guards, cameras; all because people like you can't keep their grubby hands off other people's property. 'The vast majority of this country, many of whom are in far worse situations than you, hold their heads up high and live honest lives. 'You obviously regard yourself as far too clever to be like them.' The judge told Dawn Bainbridge as he jailed her: 'You now have time to think about the effects of your offences on your family. You were the mother and leader of the criminal firm. At Newcastle Crown Court last year Judge Sean Morris jailed Dawn Bainbridge, 47, for 30 months, daughter Claire Bainbridge, 21, for 20 months and Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, to 16 months behind bars . 'You are the villain of the piece. It's your fault your daughters are in court. Some mother.' Jamie Adams, defending Caitlyn, said at the sentencing hearing: 'The whole scenario is reminiscent of something Dickens would write about. 'Fagin comes to mind in the form of her mother.' The family stole from stores in Leeds, Bradford, Guiseley, York, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Durham, Gateshead and Edinburgh. Their operation was uncovered by an investigator for high street chain Next, who bought clothes from the Facebook page and proved they were stolen. When police raided the family home last March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000. But still the thieving continued. Police seized a further £900-worth of stolen goods in June 2014. All three admitted conspiracy to steal at the time.", "summary": "Dawn Bainbridge, 47, and her daughters made £50,000 from shoplifting .\nThree women stole clothes and sold them on Facebook page for profit .\nBainbridge was described as 'Fagin' character and the 'villain of the piece'\nWomen don't own any assets so were ordered to pay back just £1 each ."}

Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua . Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium . It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle. Welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when Koree Britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and Wasps instantly capitalised as Varndell grabbed his second try.

The Exiles crept back into the game, though, keeping the pressure on Wasps' defence and Fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5, Tristan Roberts kicking the conversion side. Welsh started the second half well and Roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further. But Wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by Johnson in his first start as hooker. Then a swift break down the right saw Varndell free to run back around the Welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick. Elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the Exiles on his Aviva Premiership debut, as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner. Wasps instantly replied though as Tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line.

A former aide to Jeb Bush who was fired for offensive tweets has developed an app that lets you scrub embarrassing messages from the social network. Ethan Czahor has launched ‘Clear’ which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer. Users can search for keywords such as ‘gay’, ‘black’ or swear words and the program deletes any tweet that mentions them. Mr Czahor said hoped the app would ensure others do not suffer the same fate as he did. In February, Mr Czahor was fired from his job as a chief technology officer for Mr Bush, the former Florida governor and potential 2016 Presidential candidate. Among the old Twitter messages he posted was one in which he called female students ‘sluts’. One post read: ‘When I burp in the gym I feel like it’s my way of saying, ‘sorry guys, but I’m not gay’’. Mr Czahor told Time magazine: ‘Why wasn’t I smart enough to take care of this before it happens? ‘This could happen to anyone in any field - it doesn’t have to be politics - every millennial is now entering the workforce, and maybe even a senior position, and everything they’ve said online for the last 10 years is still there, and that’s a new thing for this generation’.

Users are then given a rating between 0 and 100 as to how safe their profile is and the can act accordingly based on the result. Researchers from Stanford and Cornell University recently studied 40 million posts made by 1.7 million web users to try to identify trolls. From this data they were able identify so-called Future-Banned Users (FBUs) - and Never-Banned Users (NBUs). The former are people that are more likely to exhibit antisocial behaviour on online forums, while the latter are everyday users that don't show signs of troll-like behaviour. The researchers then built an algorithm that scans posts for signs of such antisocial behaviour, and a study shows this algorithm can identify potential trolls in 80% of cases. For example, posts made by  trolls are less readable. Trolls are more likely to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to other posts. Trolls are also less likely to use positive words than other users and they swear more. In terms of activity, the study found that trolls make more comments each day, and post more times on each thread. Trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users. Mr Czahor said: ‘The most challenging part of this is determining which tweets are actually offensive, and that’s something that will take a while to get really good at’. He added he also wanted to develop the app so that it worked for other social networks and blogs. After his tweets became public it emerged that in his personal blog he praised civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. because he ‘didn’t have his pants sagged to his ankles’. Mr Czahor said: ‘You as a person exist in a lot of places on the internet, and I just feel that you have the right to at least know what’s out there, and to take care of it’. Like the general public, celebrities have often been caught out by old tweets they posted that have come back to haunt them. And when somebody becomes famous, their messages on social networks going back years are combed through by fans and put under the spotlight. In the US Trevor Noah, the new host of comedy programme The Daily Show, was criticised for old tweets in which he made anti-Semitic jokes. He also made jokes about overweight women which sparked criticism that he was the wrong man for the job. Last year Twitter made it easier to find such messages as its search option allows anyone to comb through every tweet ever published publicly. Previously you had to scroll through years of tweets or pay for expensive search software. The app is currently in beta and interested users can register their interest to be told when the app will be available for download from the iOS store.", "summary": "App created to remove posts that might cause problems with employers .\nUsers can search for keywords such as ‘gay’, ‘black’ or swear words and the software deletes any tweet that mentions them .\nCreator Ethan Czahor was fired from his job due to offensive tweets .\nAnd he said he hopes 'Clear' app will ensure others don't suffer same fate ."}

The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. ‘You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.’ The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their ‘friend and helper’. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being ‘plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends’. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then ‘rewarded’ with £5, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a £40 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would ‘choose her over everyone else’, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: ‘Age doesn't matter.’ Khubaib allegedly offered another girl £60, telling her: ‘You make me happy, I'll give you money.’ Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to £90. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: ‘What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.’ The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: ‘I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.’ He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and ‘I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved’. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: ‘We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.’ A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then ‘hooked’ with alcohol in an attempt to make them ‘compliant’ to sexual advances . A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter ‘kick-started’ the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial ‘worse than she expected’ after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: ‘We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying \"I'm stupid, I'm silly\". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. ‘Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. ‘There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.’ The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a ‘big impact’ on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: ‘After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'", "summary": "Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib convicted of raping girl, 14 .\nAlso guilty of trafficking girls as young as 12 over more than two years .\nCo-defendant cleared of raping 16-year-old and seven trafficking charges .\nConviction part of Cambridgeshire Police's probe into child sex offences ."}
{"document": "Mexican restaurant Chipotle has been leaving customers hungry for certain ingredients unsatisfied because not enough farms can meet its strict standards. The fast-casual chain, which plans on having 2,000 stores by the end of the year, removed carnitas pork burritos from roughly a third of its locations in January, but still doesn't have a stable supply of the meat. Chipotle, which dropped one of its pork vendors earlier this year, only uses humanely-raised pigs that have not received added hormones, though they have become harder to acquire after demand has risen. Fast-casual chain Chipotle says that it does not know when it will have enough pork to supply all of its stores with sustainably raised meat for its carnitas burritos (file photo) 'We don’t know for sure when we’ll be fully supplied again,' Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold told Bloomberg. The restaurant's pigs also need access to the outdoors and living spaces with large supplies of straw for their meat to make it into Chipotle burritos, tacos and bowls. Other retailers such as grocery store chain Kroger have begun taking up some of Chipotle's ethical standards. McDonald's pledged to stop using chickens treated with antibiotics at its stores in the next two years. The grocer and Dunkin Donuts have both said they will stop using pork from farms with gestation crates, where sows are kept in two-foot wide containers and are repeatedly impregnated without being able to move. The carnitas pork shoulder meat at Chipotle (pictured in burrito) comes from pigs that are raised outside or in living spaces with large supplies of straw (file photo) However, fewer than five per cent of pigs in the US are raised in a way that meets Chipotle's standards, according to CBS. It has been rotating its small supply of pork, of which it uses only pork shoulder, to different stores so that each location can have carnitas at least sometimes. Farmers are wary of the increased production cost for premium, antibiotic-free pork and worry about finding people to pay an appropriate price for the 'premium' meat after Denver-based Chipotle has the bits it wants. Chipotle said that supply constraints were behind 6.3 per cent price increases last year. As of Thursday morning, its stock price had fallen more than five points since news of the continued shortage was published Wednesday. Chipotle says that constraints on receiving supplies that met their standards led to 6.3 per cent price increases last year (file photo) When sustainably raised beef runs out, the store uses conventionally raised cows, but it views the conditions of factory farmed pigs by the world's biggest pork producers as particularly bad. Beyond the farming side, regular US pork production was also criticized earlier this year by meat inspectors after several of the nation's slaughterhouses transferred to a new system that increases the numbers of hogs killed per minute to 1,300. Whistleblowers from the United States Department of Agriculture said that toenails, hair and fecal matter may be creeping into Americans' pork under the new regulations. Chipotle's most popular protein is chicken, with only seven per cent of entree orders calling for carnitas. The restaurant has also warned of possible guacamole shortages.", "summary": "Mexican restaurant chain cut carnitas pork from third of stores this year .\nCompany doesn't know when it will be fully supplied again .\nDunkin Donuts, McDonald's switching to more sustainably raised meat .\nFarmers need buyers for 'premium' pig parts after Chipotle takes shoulders ."}

{"document": "Hanging on one 93-year-old man's wall at a Kentucky nursing home was a photo collage of him and his wife. It was titled 'Lill & Bill, together forever'. That sentiment came true this week when, after 73 years of marriage, William 'Wild Bill' Wilson and his wife Lillian Karr Wilson died just two minutes apart from each other. Both Lillian, 89, and Bill were Alzheimer's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes. Lillian resided at Richmond Place in Lexington, while Bill stayed at the Thomson-Hood Veterans Center in Wilmore. After 73 years of marriage, high school sweethearts Doug Wilson, 93, and Lillian Kerr Wilson, 89, passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week . But on Tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons, Doug, received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away. Just five minutes later the phone rang again. Doug said it was his mother's nursing home, calling with the same sad news. 'We all look at it as a blessing,' Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader, 'because we're going to have one funeral for both of them.' Doug, 66, believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve. 'We’re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life,' he told the Washington Post. The couple first met in Corbin, where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts. Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he doesn't believe 'either one of them had the blessings of their parents.' But that didn't stop the couple, who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage. Bill enlisted in the Army when World War II began. After returning from Germany, he worked and managed various department and retail stores. Doug told the Washington Post that his mother, who he said 'had great taste', could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows. The family, which also included Doug's brothers Mike and Terry, hopped around the state and country. There were setbacks along the way. The couple unsuccessfully tried to open a shopping center in Atlanta and then one of Bill's department stores burned down and couldn't reopen after they moved back to Kentucky. The couple first met in Corbin, Kentucky and, according to their son Doug, ran off and got married without either of their parents' blessing. They spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other . But Doug said his parents had a 'driving force' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have. 'They stressed college so much,' Doug said. 'And they were so proud that they had three sons who had college degrees.' And there were successes. After managing a number of stores, Bill decided to open his own realty firm. It grew from an $800 investment into a $1million-dollar company. He would also flip foreclosures, remodeling the houses before putting them back on the market. Meanwhile Lillian would repaint, wallpaper and do the trim work on the homes while Doug did the carpentry work. 'We had a great time rehabbing houses together,' he said. Bill was also known for his long-running morning radio show, where he was known as 'Wild Bill' and would organize a number of promotions and contests, including a twist-dancing competition that was so popular the police had to be brought in. The nickname stuck with Bill long after his radio show ended. He was even called 'Wild Bill' at his nursing home, where he would sometimes reenact his show in the cafeteria. Doug said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the Veterans center. He said that, although the couple 'didn't have communication', he believes they were 'reading each other' just by having the chance to see each other. When Doug last saw his father the Sunday before his passing, he said Bill was wearing an oxygen mask and was 'barely hanging on'. To comfort him, Doug recited the opening that Bill used to say for every one of his radio shows. 'I just told him, \"This is Wild Bill Wilson, your red-headed, freckle-faced, snaggle-toothed, snuff-dipping buddy\"'. 'And underneath the mask there, he grinned real big. He heard it. I was glad of that.' Friends and family will gather on Saturday evening for a 'Celebration of life' service in honor of the devoted couple.", "summary": "William 'Wild Bill' Wilson, 93, and Lillian Karr Wilson, 89, were both Alzheimer's patients and had to live in separate nursing homes .\nBut their son Doug often drove Lillian to see Bill and said he believes they were able to 'read each other' even when they had trouble communicating .\nThe couple didn't have their parents' blessings when they ran off to wed .\nBut they survived a war and many moves and job changes during marriage .\nTheir shared funeral service will be a 'celebration of life'"}

On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets. Kenya terrorist attack: 6 things you need to know . Investigators marked the locations of students' bodies with numbered tags before Red Cross workers came in to send them off to morgues. They would call out to each other with the locations of the dead, reducing once promising lives, for the time being at least, to numbers. 221. 214. 216. 217. Sometimes, the cell phones of the dead would ring, taking the workers aback. Beyond the bodies, evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere. Shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor. Walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes. In some places, the blood was as thick as mud. The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts . According to students and authorities, militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. Thursday. The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won't be shot. \"They were lying,\" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they'd usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. \"Shoot them! Shoot them!\" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn't belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. \"Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,\" Titus said the gunman in charge said. \"We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we're going to be killed,\" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. \"In the time of shooting, they skipped me,\" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo.

{"document": "The former chairman of Bradford City was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze that killed 56, a new book has claimed. Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time. After an inquiry, high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette. West Yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Then-Bradford chairman Heginbotham (left) was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze, it has been claimed . Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, spent 15 years researching the disaster in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed. He was 12 at the time and after painstaking investigation of public documents has published his findings in his book: 'Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire', serialised in The Guardian. The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985, and was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. Within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. The fire was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand .

His research includes claims that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the previous 18 years, which resulted in large insurance claims. The book, published on Thursday, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was noticed at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' wrote Mr Fletcher. 'From standing around with a bunch of kids and onlookers on a Sunday afternoon in May 1967, as his former foam-cushion business went up in flames, to standing on the pitch at Valley Parade 18 years later, making noises about smoke bombs while 56 people perished behind him.'

No-one sought accountability for the fire once the official Popplewell Inquiry had recorded its findings following a series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. But Mr Fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster, scouring back-copies of the local paper, The Telegraph and Argus for information. Sir Olive Popplewell told Sky News today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985. He said they were a 'remarkable coincidence' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an 'accident exacerbated by negligence'. He added: 'If we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation, but I am not sure what they would have revealed.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident.

After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. Mr Sutcliffe told Press Association Sport: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. Mr Fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster, when she told him it had not been Heginbotham's first fire . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Heginbotham's son, James, 47, told the Daily Mirror today: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. It was a shock hearing this today, it was such a long time ago. 'He's no longer here to defend himself. It's a real shame it has come to this. 'He devoted his entire life to that club. He saved the club on two separate occasions. 'I have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club.' According to the Independent, it would be up to Home Secretary Theresa May to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month.", "summary": "Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating blaze was not an accident .\nBook reveals fires at other businesses owned by or associated with then club chairman Stafford Heginbotham .\nMr Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, says his findings warrant investigation .\nAn inquiry into fire found it was an accident caused by discarded cigarette .\nWest Yorkshire Police will consider any fresh evidence that comes to light ."}
{"document": "An ancient Buddhist meditation practice could be as effective as modern drugs at beating depression, new research suggests. A study published in The Lancetfound mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) led to similar outcomes as antidepressants when treating the mental disorder. Mindfulness - which teaches people to focus on the present moment – is a growing movement based on ancient Eastern traditions of meditation. Scroll down for video . Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which teaches people to focus on the present moment, has similar recurrence rates as anti-depressants, a study found . Researchers found patients on a MBCT course suffered almost the same rates of recurrence as those taking anti-depressants. Over two years, relapse rates were 44 per cent in the MBCT group compared to 47 per cent in the medication group. This suggests it offers an 'alternative treatment' for those averse to the idea of taking drugs, said the researchers. A course of MBCT treatment typically lasts for eight weeks and mainly relies on meditation but also includes cognitive behaviour therapy and yoga. It's designed to help the patient develop a healthier, more accepting relationship with their thoughts and feelings. Professor Richard Byng, of the Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, said: 'Currently, maintenance antidepressant medication is the key treatment for preventing relapse, reducing the likelihood of relapse or recurrence by up to two-thirds when taken correctly. 'However, there are many people who - for a number of different reasons - are unable to keep on a course of medication for depression. 'Moreover, many people do not wish to remain on medication for indefinite periods, or cannot tolerate its side effects.' The first study of its kind discovered MBCT isn't more effective than antidepressants but could offer similar protection - with no significant difference in cost. Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress. The guiding principle is to live more 'in the moment', spending less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems. Techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called 'body scan'. A secular practice, it is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures. Professor Willem Kuyken, of Oxford University, said: 'Depression is a recurrent disorder. 'Without ongoing treatment as many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point.' MBCT was developed to help people who have experienced repeated bouts of depression by teaching them the skills to recognise and respond constructively to the thoughts and feelings associated with relapse - thereby preventing a downward spiral. In the study, 424 adults with recurrent major depression were split into two group at random - half remaining on antidepressants and the others coming off and receiving MBCT. The latter group attended eight group sessions lasting two-and-a-quarter hours and were given daily home practice. Afterwards they had the option of attending four follow up sessions over a 12 month period. The MBCT course consists of guided mindfulness practices, group discussion and other cognitive behavioural exercises. Those in the maintenance antidepressant group continued their medication for two years. All trial participants were assessed at regular intervals over two years for a major depressive episode using a psychiatric diagnostic interview tool. Although five adverse events were reported - including two deaths - across both groups they were not judged to be attributable to the interventions or the trial. Professor Sarah Byford, of King's College London, said: 'As a group intervention mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was relatively low cost compared to therapies provided on an individual basis. As many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point, experts said. An MBCT course could be offered as an alternative to drugs . 'In terms of the cost of all health and social care services used by participants during the study - we found no significant difference between the two treatments.' Professor Kuyken added that although the MBCT doid not work any better than anti-depressants, the results suggest a 'new choice' for the millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions. Study participant Nigel Reed, of Sidmouth in Devon, said: 'Mindfulness gives me a set of skills which I use to keep well in the long term. 'Rather than relying on the continuing use of antidepressants mindfulness puts me in charge, allowing me to take control of my own future, to spot when I am at risk and to make the changes I need to stay well.' Professor Roger Mulder, of Otago University in New Zealand who reviewed the study for then journal, said: 'Because it's a group treatment that reduces costs and the number of trained staff needed it might be feasible to offer MBCT as a choice to patients in general practice. 'We therefore have a promising new treatment that is reasonably cost effective and applicable to the large group of patients with recurrent depression.'", "summary": "Patients using mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) had the same recurrence rates as people taking anti-depressants .\nMindfulness meditation  teaches people to focus on the present moment .\nExperts said MBCT courses could be offered as an alternative to drugs ."}
{"document": "(CNN)The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has claimed an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in Kenya, the most well-known of them being the massacre at the Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi in 2013. Cross-border raids into Kenya by the group, however, date back to 2011. Al-Shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in Nairobi, which sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission in support of Somalia's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from Al-Shabaab and other militants for several years. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS (also known as Islamic State), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. Its origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami (Unity of Islam), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991. These disparate groups fought each other and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country, from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later. Al-Shabaab (literally \"the Youth\") split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group, the so-called Islamic Courts Union. As their alliance obtained control of Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 2006, Ethiopia, the only majority Christian country in the region, took military action against the group. The offensive weakened Al-Shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern Somalia, but it failed to defeat it. To the contrary, Ethiopia's invasion and occupation of parts of Somalia -- although invited by the Somali government and backed by the African Union -- enabled Al-Shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an Islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign \"Christian\" invasion. Initially, the group primarily attacked Ethiopian forces, but soon began to \"expand\" its activities against the Somali government as well. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids in Kenya began, predominantly targeting Christians there. Increasing its links with al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to ISIS. Much will depend on how the relationships between al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a long-time ally of Al-Shabaab based in Yemen, and ISIS develop. The key point is that Al-Shabaab's attack in Garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors. It must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism. Clearly, the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern, and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of Islam. But the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems: from economic development challenges to environmental degradation; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance. These entrenched inequalities help Al-Shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits, who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons. Attacking a university in northern Kenya and separating Christian from Muslim students epitomizes the way Al-Shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious, tribal and nationalist identities. Ultimately, though, this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people, over territory, and over resources. As long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political, economic, and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests. It is important to counter Al-Shabaab directly, including by military means. But there won't be any lasting solution to the wider region's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by Al-Shabaab. As Garissa shows, these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit. Copyright 2015 The Conversation.

{"document": "In her working life, she has covered terrorist attacks, murders and explosions. But nothing, it seems, has been a greater challenge for Samantha Simmonds than a car journey with her three children. The Sky newsreader has revealed how an Easter holiday outing with her family saw ‘blood and saliva flying’ between her boisterous sons in the backseat – and ended with her six-year-old having a tooth knocked out. Butter wouldn’t melt! Samantha Simmonds and husband Phillip Davies with their children, two, four and six . In a searingly honest account that plenty of exhausted parents will relate to, Miss Simmonds, 42, described how she took some time off work to spend with her children – but said the break turned into a string of tantrums and bickering. Miss Simmonds is married to Phillip Davies, the owner of online auction business Flogit4u, and the couple have a daughter aged two and sons aged four and six. Describing a trip back from Manchester to London, the newsreader wrote on her blog that four hours into a fraught journey, her six-year-old son started screaming. She said: ‘I turned round to see blood and saliva flying towards me and all over [the six-year-old’s] face. I started yelling in shock and shouted to the four-year-old, “What have you done?” ‘What he had done was knock one of his brother’s teeth out! How is that even possible?’ After ‘one packet of wet wipes, a lot of blood and tears’, she wrote, the situation was calmer, and it wasn’t long before her enterprising son was negotiating more money from the tooth fairy ‘due to blood loss and trauma’. Honest: In her blog post, the Sky newsreader and mother-of-three also describes ‘working mum guilt’ The newsreader – who has worked for Channel 5 and BBC News as well as Sky – said she struggled to cope when the boys turned on each other in the car. ‘On their own they are all gorgeous – a delight – a pleasure! Together they are a ticking time bomb,’ she wrote. ‘Just how long before the first verbal or physical punch is thrown is anyone’s guess. It is this – the dynamics of the three of them all together that I find the single hardest thing about being a parent … I feel unprepared and frustratingly un-forewarned of the trials and tribulations of dealing with my children en masse.’ In the post, which does not give her children’s names, she also describes the ‘working mum guilt’ shared by many, and how she tries to squeeze in as many activities as possible during precious time off. ‘Many would argue I do too much …. that may well be so, but I genuinely love our outings and seeing the joy and wonder on their faces,’ she wrote. But the dream can quickly turn into a nightmare when ‘their testosterone-fuelled little bodies means they cannot keep their hands off each other for more than a few minutes at a time’. She added: ‘Either kicking one another while sitting on the sofa, or wrestling around the house and taking it in turn to jump on each other’s heads – our two-year-old daughter included. ‘Pre parenthood, like many childless adults I would stare agog in the streets and in restaurants – at the out of control parent screaming at their equally out of control children … Oh how easy it is to judge! I am now that parent!’", "summary": "Samantha Simmonds posted honest blog about Easter family break .\nDetailed how youngest son, four, knocked six-year-old's tooth out .\nWrote of 'ticking time bomb' when all three children are together .\nIn the post the newsreader, 42, also describes ‘working mum guilt’"}

An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to the 15-year-old boy from the seven-storey Hilton Guesthouse. Speaking shortly before he was rescued, Andrew Olvera, who was heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'He's not too far down. 'But the floors have collapsed and he'd pancaked between them.' Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors were hanging down in front like curtains. 'The whole operation is dangerous,' he said. 'But its risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.'

Today mother Rasmila Awal thanked 'God and the rescuers' for saving the infant from death. Mrs Awal, 35, tells MailOnline: 'I am so happy to have my baby back. I'm so happy that he is alive.' Sonish was asleep in his cot upstairs when the walls of his home came crashing down around him. His parents and older sister, aged 10, were outside when the tremor struck and desperately tried to reach him.

Relief: Sister Soniya Awal, 10, father Shyam Awal, 34, mother Rasmila Awal, 35, with baby Sonit Awal in front of their devastated house . Father Shyam Awal worked tirelessly with friends and neighbours to try to free the boy, digging with their bare hands through the rubble. But without the proper equipment it was impossible. The frantic mother could not sleep or eat throughout the 22-hour separation from her young son. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission. Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver told MailOnline: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.' Now the family are homeless and living in the street under a tarpaulin opposite their house. The once smart four-storey structure lies in ruins across the road.

Another survivor who was trapped under rubble next to dead bodies for 82 hours has had one of his legs amputated, it was revealed today. Rishi Khanal, 27, had just finished lunch at a hotel in Kathmandu  when the 7.8-magnitude quake caused the building to crumble around him. He became trapped with his foot crushed under rubble and stayed alive by drinking his own urine. Doctors said they were forced to amputate a leg because of damage from prolonged internal bleeding. Their survival stories are a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the Himalayan nation. Today, rescuers toiled in pouring rain among the debris, but officials said the chance of finding any more survivors was bleak as the death toll neared 5,500. 'I was certain I was going to die': Rishi Khanal is carried out of a collapsed hotel in Kathmandu on a stretcher after being trapped under rubble for 82 hours following the earthquake that struck Nepal four days ago . Relief: Mr Khanal said he was surrounded by dead bodies. But he kept banging on the rubble all around him and eventually this brought a French rescue team that extracted him after an operation lasting many hours . While rescue teams were out in the capital Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside of the impoverished Himalayan nation. 'There may not be any more survivors,' said Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepal's home ministry. 'The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.' Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared yesterday with protests outside parliament. Villagers blocked trucks carrying supplies, demanding the government do more to hasten the distribution of aid that has flooded into the country but has been slow to reach those in need. An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths from Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake had risen to 5,489 by Thursday morning. Almost 11,000 were injured, and more than 80 were also killed in neighbouring India and Tibet. Many people have been sleeping in the open after the quake - the United Nations has said 600,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. Workers excavate bodies as they take part in a rescue operation at Kolache-2 in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu .

Lives ruined: People sort through the rubble of buildings which collapsed in Sathighar, north of Kathmandu . It has said eight million people have been affected, with at least two million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months. Dandal said foreign rescue teams had told him that their work is almost done because there is little chance of finding any survivors. Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters. There are currently about 20 Nepali army, private and Indian army helicopters involved in rescue operations, according to Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a home ministry official. China is expected to send helicopters today, he said. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in.

People walk past a collapsed building in the UNESCO world heritage site of Bhaktapur outside Kathmandu . That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the nation of 28 million people sandwiched between India and China. In Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all. Guna Raj, who works for a Kathmandu-based NGO specialising in providing sanitation, said there have been outbreaks of diarrhoea in relief camps because of a shortage of toilets and clean water. 'In the next few days or weeks I am sure there will be an outbreak of epidemics,' said Raj, who is involved in the relief effort. Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate for relief surfaced, rescuers said, as fresh avalanches were reported in several areas. Members of Israeli search-and-rescue group Magnus said hundreds of tourists, including about 100 Israelis, were airlifted out of Langtang in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu hit by an avalanche on Tuesday. But at least two foreigners, whose nationalities were as yet unknown, were found dead, the home ministry said. Fights had broken out there because of food shortages, Magnus team member Amit Rubin said. One of the trekkers said there had also been scuffles over places on the rescue helicopters. The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 18 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst disaster on the world's highest peak.", "summary": "Crowds cheered as Pema Lama was pulled, dazed and dusty, from rubble .\nPlaced on stretcher with an IV drip in his arm and a brace around his neck .\nComes as mother is reunited with baby rescued after 22 hours in rubble .\nMedic said teenager became 'pancaked' between two floors when quake hit .\nAnother survivor rescued after 82 hours has had one of his legs amputated ."}

{"document": "Iran's Revolutionary Guards 'harassed' a US-flagged commercial ship just days before it seized a vessel carrying cargo and 34 sailors, it has emerged. The two incidents have raised concerns about the security of shipping lanes in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. News of the first incident was revealed by the Pentagon after Iranian guards seized MV Maersk Tigris this week, by firing warning shots across the vessel's bows. ranian patrol vessels fired warning shots across the bridge of the Marshall Islands-flagged cargo vessel the Maersk Tigris Tuesday morning and seized it for trespassing just days after it had 'harassed' another ship . In the April 24 incident, four Iranian patrol boats with the country's elite Revolutionary Guards 'harassed a US-flagged merchant ship called the Maersk Kensington' as it moved along an established shipping route, said Mr Warren. The Iranian vessels 'followed her for approximately 15 to 20 minutes in actions the ship master of the Kensington interpreted as aggressive,' he said. The American military was not involved in the incident and the Kensington's captain later filed a report with the US Navy describing the event. Just four days later, Iranian boats forced a Marshall Islands-flagged ship, the Maersk Tigris, to Iran's Larak Island after firing warning shots across the bows and boarding the vessel. Iran has said it seized control of the container ship due to a commercial dispute with Denmark's giant Maersk group, which chartered the vessel to ferry cargo in the region. When it was intercepted, the Tigris was traveling on an international shipping route within Iran's territorial waters. 'It's difficult to know exactly why the Iranians are behaving this way,' Warren said. 'We call on them to respect all of the internationally established rules of freedom of navigation, the law of the sea to which they are a signatory and other established protocols,' he said. The 52,600-ton container ship was built in 2014 and is managed by Singapore-based Rickmers Ship Management . Iranian sources have seized the cargo ship and claim they had a legal order following a dispute . In a statement, the Iranian Port and Maritime Organisation said the Maersk Tigris was intercepted 'upon a legal order' and transferred to Shahid Bahonar port in southern Iran. Officials claimed the order was issued following a 'long running commercial dispute' with Maersk. The ruling was 'based on a lawsuit by a private company called Pars Talayieh Oil Product company (Golden Pars Oil Products) against Maersk ship company,' it said. They said the ship can only be released following a judicial ruling. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking at New York University, said a lawsuit was filed against the ship's owners between 15 and 16 years ago over an undelivered cargo. 'It has gone through court proceedings in Tehran based on what I hear from the lawyer. The final decision by the court is that the ship's owners are supposed to pay damages,' he said. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television station reported earlier the vessel was US-flagged, but it has since emerged that the cargo ship is registered in the Pacific island nation and had no Americans aboard. The semi-official Iranian news agency Fars also reported that Iran took control of the MV Maersk Tigris for 'trespassing' on its territorial waters. Warren said the cargo ship's master had initially refused an Iranian order to move further into Iranian waters, but after the warning shots were fired the cargo ship complied. The vessel was then boarded by Iranians, but no one has been injured and no Americans are involved. Detained: A map of the vessel's route shows that it abruptly changed course in the Strait of Hormuz this morning and was heading to the Iranian port on Bandfar Abbas . Warren said the cargo ship issued a distress call and US Naval Forces Central Command, based in the area, sent a US destroyer, the USS Farragut, and a P-3 surveillance aircraft to the area of the incident to monitor the situation. 'What they are doing is keeping an eye on things. They are in close enough proximity to the Maersk Tigris that they will be able to respond if a response is required,' he added. As the US government had defense and other ties with the Marshall Islands, US officials were 'in discussion with the Marshall Islands on the way ahead,' he said. 'The Republic of Marshall Islands has requested assistance for the release of the Maersk ship, and again, we're in communication with them about how best to expect that outcome,' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. But US officials said privately that no military action was imminent. According to the ship-tracking site MarineTraffic.com, the 52,600-ton cargo vessel, which was built last year, departed from Ambarli, Turkey April 8 en route to Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

A map of the vessel's route shows that it abruptly changed course in the Strait of Hormuz this morning and was heading to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. New of the seizure and action against another vessel comes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf, fuelled by the Yemen conflict and high-stakes diplomacy between Washington and Tehran over Iran's nuclear program. In October 2012, Maersk announced a halt to its activities in Iran after Western oil and financial sanctions were slapped on the country over its controversial nuclear program. The ship was operated by Rickmers Ship Management, with head offices in Singapore and Hamburg, and was carrying cargo for Maersk Line, the group's shipping unit which had chartered the vessel. A spokesman for the Danish group said the Maersk Tigris does not belong to the company and it does not employ the crew. The shipping group A.P. Moeller-Maersk also said Wednesday that the crew was safe but it remained tight-lipped about any commercial dispute.", "summary": "Iran Revolutionary Guards seized MV Maersk Tigris with 34 sailors aboard .\nIranian navy harassed another Maersk ship days before, Pentagon said .\nRevelations have raised concerns about the security of shipping lanes .\nOfficials from Iran claimed they seized Maersk Tigris under a legal order following a long running legal dispute with the shipping company ."}
{"document": "A 16-year-old boy has admitted trying to buy a biological toxin that is 30 times more deadly than ricin from undercover police on the 'dark web'. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wanted to obtain abrin online. He was caught after an investigation was launched by the North West counter-terrorism unit in January. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods online without being found by traditional search engines . Today he pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court. He will be sentenced later this month for the offence, which is contrary to the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and Section 1 of the Biological Weapons Act 1974. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. The investigation came after information was passed to law enforcement officers who were covertly in communication with the 16-year-old, who had expressed an interest in acquiring the poison on the dark web. The dark web is a subsection of the net - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. It is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. During the online chats, the teenager showed awareness of the drug's toxicity and the potential for it to be used to cause considerable harm, police said. On February 6, the youth attempted to place an order and also suggested he wanted to make future purchases in larger quantities.

{"document": "David Curry (pictured) was asked to leave The Wallow Wetherspoon pub in Blyth, Northumberland because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms . A father was asked to leave a Wetherspoon pub for a family breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms. David Curry, 49, had travelled ten miles from  home to visit The Wallow in Blyth, Northumberland, for the first time with wife Vee, 45, and her daughter Kayleigh. But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of £40 Adidas trousers. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry, from Ashington, but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013. 'I go to my local Wetherspoon pub in Ashington all the time wearing track suit bottoms and we have never been denied entry,' said Mr Curry. 'We decided to go to this one instead for a change of scene. 'We had just walked in and were just about to go to the bar when a waiter said \"excuse me you have got to leave, you are wearing track suit bottoms\". 'I couldn't believe it. I just had to laugh and walk away.' Instead, the family travelled back to Ashington and went to a nearby pub for Sunday lunch. Self-employed builder Mr Curry said he often wears sportswear as part of a health regime that saw him shed 17 stone through exercise and giving up alcohol. He had been drinking 25 pints a day and ballooned to 28 stone, but changed his ways and started running up to 20 miles a day after being told he would die if he did not lose weight. Teaching assistant Mrs Curry said the pub chain has lost money by turning the family away at the door. 'I said you are joking! We had just come for our breakfast. When Mr Curry arrived at the pub with his wife and stepdaughter he was told he could not order a drink because of his attire . 'Dave was wearing a pair of £40 trousers, they weren't cheap. 'Yet he was being told to leave by a waiter who hadn't even ironed his uniform. The waiter looked really scruffy. 'There are people wearing tracksuit bottoms in Wetherspoons all the time. 'It was the first time we had ever visited that Wetherspoon pub and we won't be coming back. 'We just left - we were fuming.' Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: 'Wetherspoon apologise to the gentleman and completely understand his disappointment. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013 . 'The pub has operated a no tracksuit policy since opening towards the end of 2013. 'We appreciate that the gentleman in question wasn't aware of this and we would also ask our staff to use discretion. 'However on this occasion the fact is he was refused service and to reiterate we apologise to him for this.'

{"document": "Chances are you've been to Malaga. Well, the airport at any rate. Every year, millions of us pass through on the way to the beaches of the Costa del Sol or palaces of Granada. But, now, the southern Spanish port is having a moment. Thanks to a multi-million pound regeneration project, and several new galleries and museums, this once down-at-heel city has become one of Europe's hippest destinations. Incoming: The Centre Pompidou Malaga, a pop-up version of the Parisian institution, has opened to visitors . Along with a thriving cultural scene, there are good restaurants, great shopping and exciting nightlife. This week saw the opening of Centre Pompidou Malaga, the first of several popup versions of the famous Parisian gallery planned outside France. It is housed in a low-slung white building topped with a giant glass cube in the trendy harbour area. When I turn up, a large crowd is queuing to pay the £6.70 entrance fee to view 90 works by artists such as Miro, Magritte and Picasso on loan from the Pompidou in France, plus an exhibition exploring dance and choreography. There's a brilliant room of self-portraits, including a Francis Bacon and Frida Kahlo. Drawing a big huddle is Kader Attia's striking installation, Ghost — a mass of Muslim women in prayer, made from tin foil. Pompidou is the latest bold step in branding Malaga a 'City of Museums'. Across town, the first overseas branch of St Petersburg State Russian Museum has just opened in a refurbished tobacco factory. Take a good look: Gibralfaro Castle offers fine views of the city, with the Mediterranean as a wide backdrop . Next door is the Malaga Automobile Museum, an extraordinary celebration of cars, fashion and art. By 2016, a Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology will complete the set. Malaga's Picasso Museum opened in 2003 — a long-held dream of the artist, who was born in the city in 1881. The Automobile Museum in Malaga houses around 90 classic cars, plus displays of haute couture . Round the corner, you can peek into Santiago church where he was baptised. The Picasso Birthplace Museum in the house where he lived until he was ten, contains more paintings, ceramics, early photos, belongings and sketchbooks. What sets Malaga apart — for now, at least — is that all these galleries tend to be uncrowded, refreshingly small, and most in walking distance of each other. That means there's plenty of time to explore Andalusian cuisine. Get in the mood at the buzzing Atarazanas market, then try the terrace at El Pimpi, which overlooks the Roman amphitheatre. For unbeatable seafood, take the bus to the beach at Pedregalejo on the city's outskirts, where locals feast on freshly caught boquerones (anchovies, often deep fried), espetos (sardines, barbecued on sticks) and platters of enormous mussels, prawns and clams. For modern minimalism, head to the sleek gastrobars of the arty Soho district, such as KGB, where punky young things queue for tables. 'Seville just stays the same,' one girl tells me over fusion tapas and a beer. 'Malaga is moving on.' Green and pleasant: Malaga's botanical garden plays host to exotic plants from around the world . Near the Pompidou is the city's botanic gardens, rated as one of the best in Europe and bursting with palms, exotic plants and squawking birds. Also to see are the Moorish Alcazaba fortress and Gibralfaro castle, where you can enjoy fabulous panoramic views of the city. Visitor numbers are already soaring — with some people saying Malaga will be like Barcelona in ten years' time. I'm tempted to agree with them. British Airways (0844 4930787, www.ba.com) has daily flights from London to Malaga from £82 return.

{"document": "New pictures have emerged of Louis Tomlinson's wild night of partying with a group of five girls. The One Direction star was seen barefoot and sat on the edge of a sofa during a stay at London's Soho Hotel on Wednesday night, in which he appeared to be rolling a joint while sat next to a box filled with a suspicious substance. And now, a series of newly-released Snapchat shots of the raucous gathering have emerged, appearing to show the 23-year-old singer in his hotel room in the company of friends in the small hours of Thursday morning. Scroll down for video . Up all night: Louis Tomlinson is clearly visible in previously unseen pictures from his wild night out with five girls, taken before he was pictured rolling a 'suspicious cigarette' in his hotel room in London . Jokes: The Snapchat video shows Louis back in his room at the Soho Hotel in London with his female friends, as one of them jokes that they aren't sure which member of One Direction he is . One social media snap captioned with the time showed the wild party going on until at least 5.48am. Another image shows newly-single Louis partying at the nightclub beforehand in the company of a green-haired young lady holding up a cigarette, with the caption 'love' over the image. Shots taken from a Snapchat video show the back of Louis within the hotel room while a person - whose face is obscured - lays on the couch in front of him. Across the image reads the joke caption: 'apparently hes one direction lol? Harry? Dunn', hinting that the girls pretending to be unaware which member of the globally-revered group he was. Change of clothing: Although Louis was seen returning to the Soho Hotel in the same Brooklyn-emblazoned jumper that he wore in the 'spliff' picture, he seemed to have removed the sweater for a time . Crowd in: Louis returned to the Soho Hotel after leaving Cirque Le Soir at 4am with his female friends, in the same t-shirt he was seen wearing in the Snapchat images . Perhaps taken from the very same video, the young singer is also seen playing the 'air guitar', according to the written comment. Louis - who split from his long-term love Eleanor Calder weeks ago - was photographed leaving the Soho Hotel after a long night of partying with his pals in the city on Thursday, with a rather sheepish look on his face. He was still clad in the very same outfit he had worn during his raucous night out, which saw him leave Soho's Cirque Le Soir nightclub at 4am and head back to his hotel room to continue the party. After the party: Louis returned to his hotel in London's Soho on Thursday, apparently after the pictures of him with the roll up were taken - he is wearing the very same Brooklyn sweater as in the images . That's the shirt! As Louis arrived back at his Soho hotel at around 4.30am on Thursday morning, he was wearing the very same white tee as in the Snapchat images . Raucous: The 1D star seemed in fantastic spirits as he returned with his female friends and a man who appeared to be a member of his security team . Clinging on: A pretty brunette held onto the star's arm as they entered the hotel . Although Louis was seen wearing the same white 'Brooklyn' jumper when he was pictured with the suspicious 'cigarette', the garment he was seen walking around the hotel in the following day, the Snapchat images show him to be wearing a t-shirt. And it's the very same white top he wore on his return to the hotel after leaving the club, when he was seen getting out of a taxi filled with his gaggle of female friends. The party pals stepped out of the car and made their way as a group into the hotel, seemingly to carry on the atmosphere. Tired? Since spitting from his long-term girlfriend Eleanor Calder in March, Louis has enjoyed several nights out with mystery females . Popular location: Two of the young ladies who spent the evening celebrating with Louis were later seen leaving the Soho Hotel . The original picture showed Louis perching on the edge of the sofa in the hotel room, presumably after their all-night celebration. The image, which shows the One Direction star poised with the suspicious roll-up and sitting next to a plastic tub containing a dry, green weed-like substance and rolling paper, was taken in the early hours of Thursday morning. That same day he was photographed returning to his London hotel in a disheveled state clutching a glass of water. The singer has recently been letting his hair down and enjoying his newly-single status, after breaking up from his girlfriend of four years, Eleanor Calder, in March. In the original picture, apparently taken in London  during this two-day party session, Tomlinson appears to be smiling as he balances a magazine on his lap, smiling distractedly at a girl by his side as he prepares the suspicious cigarette. It is the latest blow to the boy band just one month after Zayn Malik announced his decision to quit the group. 'Happy days': What Louis Tomlinson was heard saying as Zayn Malik smoked what appeared to be marijuana as the band was ferried to a stadium in Lima, the capital of Peru, for a concert . Shortly before his announcement it had emerged that Zayn, 22, and Louis were being forced to post bonds worth close to $12,000 to be allowed into the Philippines where they were due to play a concert in Manila. The money was to be forfeited if either were caught using illegal drugs while there. And the new picture comes in the wake of a video filmed last April where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a joint during the Latin American Leg of their 2014 stadium tour. The explosive video obtained by Daily Mail Online last May sent shock waves through One Direction’s young fan base. Still partying: Louis headed for a night on the town in London on Thursday . Past love: Louis ended his four-year relationship with Eleanor Calder back in March . Louis could be heard narrating from behind the camera as he filmed his bandmate on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru. At one point he announced: ‘So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!’ Fellow band members Harry Styles, Liam Payn and Niall Horan were not present as, during the 15 minute journey in a smoke filled SUV, Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joked with each other and three members of their crew who are travelling with them. A member of the team asked about the filming: ‘Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?’ Louis replied: ‘Yes, that’s what it is about.’ Current line-up: The four-member version of One Direction performs in South Africa last month after the departure of Zayn Malik to pursue a solo career . The way they were: Clean-cut One Direction - from left Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne . Adopting a faux serious tone as he focused on Zayn who sat beside him wearing jeans and a Bob Marley T-shirt, Louis said: ‘Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two hour intense warm-up before every show. Just to get himself in the zone for the show. ‘One very, very important factor of Zayn’s warm up of course is Mary J herself. IN fact I will present it to him now for some fantastic singing.’ The band faced heavy criticism after the video leak with thousands of fans dumping tickets to their shows. Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying, ‘I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.’ He added: ‘We are only in our 20s and we all do stupid things at this age.’ MailOnline has approached the band's spokesperson for comment.", "summary": "New images have surfaced of Louis Tomlinson's all-night partying session, which appeared to end at around 6am .\nThey follow the release of a photograph taken of 23-year-old boy band star in which he appears to be rolling a joint beside a box of green substance .\nTomlinson had been partying hard for 48 hours in London, and took five girls back to his room at the Soho Hotel .\nComes after Tomlinson appeared on exclusive Daily Mail Online video in which Zayn Malik appeared to smoke drug .\nBandmate Liam Payne then issued apology for video ."}

The research, carried out in Milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity Medical Detection Dogs. Its co-founder Dr Claire Guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as 'spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples . The latest research, by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent . They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr Guest said: 'These results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. 'It is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a 'reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. There is no single test for prostate cancer, but the most commonly used are blood tests, a physical examination or a biopsy.

Prostate cancer, pictured, is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year . 'Over the years, millions of pounds of NHS funding has been poured into the traditional test methods, and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability,' Dr Guest added. 'This has caused a huge waste of resources, not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals.

Williams improved to 19-0 this year and 15-0 for her career in Fed Cup.

In that statement, addressed to the 34 Facebook friends he had at that time, Knight said he had agreed to pay damages of £20,000 to the Sky Bet Championship club, which prompted fellow Seasiders supporter Joe Atherton to set up an account on the website gofundme.com where fans could pledge donations.

{"document": "(CNN)The Red Cross on Saturday called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in battle-torn Yemen, saying many more people recently wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting will die if not tended to soon. The call came just before the U.N. Security Council met late Saturday morning to discuss the situation in the Arabian Peninsula nation, where Shiite rebels are pitted against external Arab air forces and fighters loyal to Yemen's displaced Sunni president. A pause was needed especially in and near the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Food, water, medical items and personnel need to get into these areas, the group said. \"Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,\" Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, said. Another Red Cross official said people are running out of food, water and fuel. \"Medical supplies need to be here yesterday. The situation is difficult,\"said Marie-Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the ICRC who is in the capital, Sanaa. \"We need to save the lives that can be saved.\" Meanwhile, residents of Sanaa, witnessed the fiercest Saudi strikes since the air assault started last week. Military facilities, including two bases, within the city limits have been targeted, three senior security officials in Sanaa said. At the Security Council, Russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, has been conducting against the rebels in Yemen for more than a week. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements. It doesn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting, and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to hit the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. A Saudi source told CNN that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to Yemeni fighters in Aden loyal to Hadi. The Houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city, including the presidential palace there, the source said. Saudi special forces help oppose Houthi rebels in Yemen, source says . The United Nations said Thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in Yemen in the past two weeks. An additional 1,700 have been wounded. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Somalia and Djibouti. In Aden alone, fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days, Yemeni security officials said. At least 24 of the dead were Houthis. Complicating matters in Yemen is that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or Hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. Also late this week, photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al Qaeda leader Khaled Batarfi  -- whom Yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on Thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern Yemen. Sunni Islamist fighters freed Batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al Mukallah. On Saturday, the French military evacuated 44 people, including some French nationals, from the eastern Yemeni port city of Balhaf.

Anderson appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court wearing dark grey Islamic dress with a grey cardigan, while elderly-looking Khan appeared with a long white beard and light blue Islamic dress. Ibrahim Anderson, left, and Shah Jahah Khan, who have both pleaded guilty to terror offences today at Westminister Magistrates Court . The court heard that the charge relates to an offence on August 9 last year, when the pair are alleged to have handed out leaflets about ISIS on the busy shopping street. Anderson also denied one charge of possessing information likely to be useful for the preparation of or carrying out an act of terrorism, when police searched his property in December last year. Prosecutor Adam Harbinson told the court: 'On the August 9 last year a group of around six men erected a stall near Oxford Street.

'Although the leaflet doesn't mention ISIS in Iraq or Syria, an expert in Islamic studies has concluded the only circumstances the leaflets could possibly be making reference to are the declaration by ISIS and its leader of the establishment of an Islamic State last summer. 'The leaflet sets out that Muslims have a duty to further the causes of the caliphate. 'One of the men was challenged by members of the public as to why he was handing out leaflets calling for support of this organisation.

{"document": "The overbearing and interfering mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as most people’s least favourite family member. And now a new poll on modern families reveals this is a reality for almost a quarter of Britons – who said their pet dog was more important to them than their in-laws. Of the 2,071 people surveyed, 22 per cent cited their pets as a close family member, above in-laws (21 per cent) but below grandparents at 26 per cent. Scroll down for video . A new poll on modern families reveals almost a quarter of Brits prefer their pets to their in-laws . The research commissioned by Matalan for its Made for Modern Families campaign also found that the ‘Brady Bunch’ or ‘blended’ household where children had multi-parental figures was also on the rise. More than one in 10 British families now live in ‘blended’ families as more people with children divorce, remarry other parents and their households merge. As a result a fifth of all children – more than the entire population of Birmingham and London combined - have participated in their own parents’ wedding, the poll found. Spending quality time together as a family is still important with 65 per cent saying eating together at a table was one of their favourite family activities and 30 per cent claiming to enjoy playing board games and doing arts and crafts together. Over a third (35 per cent) said that their family’s happiness was their top priority, compared to just 6 per cent who cited money as most important. Mark Earls, a leading behavioural expert and fellow of the Marketing Society, said: ‘Contrary to those who have bemoaned the decline of the family as a key pillar of our society, family is alive and well – it just comes in many more different shapes and sizes than it used to including the “blended’ or “Brady Bunch” family, which consists of one or more adults with their own children and those from previous relationships. The interfering mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as most people’s least favourite family member, as in 2004 film Monster-in-Law starring Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez . ‘More than one in ten British families have this kind of arrangement. Such a scenario can create a situation in which the age gap between the youngest and eldest child/step-child can be more than a decade, as our survey found. ‘Ultimately, what we want for our families is what we’ve always wanted for those we love - health and happiness. However much the shape and the structures and the participants shift, it seems these same old truths abide. The family is here to stay.’ While the Beckhams were seen by 20 per cent of people questioned as the best representation of the modern family, 16 per cent thought it was Jamie Oliver’s brood, followed by the Jolie-Pitts at 7 per cent. Next in line from the list were Will Smith’s family (4 per cent) and Elton John and David Furnish (3 per cent). The research saw data compiled by YouGov reviewed by Mr Earls for Matalan as part of its commitment to understanding today’s modern families. Jason Hargreaves, Managing Director of Matalan, said: ‘Family life has changed dramatically since we first opened our doors 30 years ago. The demands on parents and families are greater than ever as time is precious, life is faster and pockets are pinched. ‘Family is at the heart of our business and we are committed to being there to help families, whatever their makeup or wherever they’re from, in everything we do.’", "summary": "Mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as least favourite family member .\nPoll on modern families reveals this is a reality for almost a quarter of Brits .\nThey said their pet dog was more important to them than their in-laws .\nResearch found households where children had multi-parental figures was also on the rise ."}
{"document": "(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real \"crossroads of America.\" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.", "summary": "Gov.

Beyoncé and Kelly joined Michelle to surprise the crowd,and opened the broadcast with a gospel medley that included the song 'Alpha & Omega' and the hit single 'Say Yes' from Michelle's 'Journey To Freedom' CD. The group received a rousing standing ovation from the 9,000-plus crowd, but they weren't introduced as Destiny's child - they were introduced by their individual names. Scroll down for video . Nameless: Singers Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland and Beyonce performing \"Say Yes\" during the 30th Annual Stellar Awards in Las Vegas last week. The singers did not refer to themselves as Destiny's Child . Touchdown: Destiny's Child perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show in 2013 . Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that the threesome want to do another ten-year reunion tour and intend to cut a reunion album - but they won't use the group name for that either. And it's all by design. 'Alhough Destiny's Child is made up of the three ladies, Beyoncé's father and former manager Mathew Knowles owns one-fourth of the group as well. Anytime they do anything under the name Destiny's Child, he has involvement in it and money from it,' a source close to the group reveals to Daily Mail Online. None of the members of Destiny's Child want any involvement with Mathew, who once managed each of their individual careers as well as the group. Kelly was first to fire him in 2009, Michelle followed in 2010 and Beyoncé finally nixed all dealings with her dad after accusations of stealing money from her in 2011. Mathew's marriage to Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles ended after it surfaced he had gotten a woman named Alexsandra Wright pregnant. Once she gave birth to their son Nixon, Tina filed for divorce. In 2014, it was revealed that Mathew fathered a second child, a four-year-old daughter named Koi. 'That it was claimed Mathew stole money from Beyoncé and then he sued to prove that he didn't was bad enough. But all of the extramarital affairs and children outside the marriage just made it so that Beyoncé doesn't have anything to do with her dad at all,' the source explained. Before the split: Destiny's Child and Matthew Knowles pose for a portrait October 30, 2000 in Houston . In late 2012, Beyoncé invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary, 'Beyoncé: Life Is But a Dream.' But after  that, says the source, she stopped communicating with him again and his only access to her is via her assistant's work email address. The trio's unwillingness to deal with Mathew is why they keep putting off a Destiny's Child reunion album and tour. Their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled tour grossed approximately $70.8 million in the U.S. alone and according to Billboard it was the highest-grossing tour for either a pop or R&B band since TLC's FanMail Tour. Beyoncé, Kelly and Michelle wanted to record a 10-year follow-up CD and launch a tour. They know both the album and tour could a huge seller and break tour records. 'The problem is they can't figure out how to nix Mathew from the deal. They all want more than anything to give the fans one last run of the group, especially since they all have their own individual success, but don't want to deal with Mathew,' the source explained. It's unlikely that Mathew would allow the women to cut any deals without him. His financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month.

But after that, says the source, she stopped communicating . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale he was having in Houston, where selling both Beyoncé and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. 'At best they maybe could offer him a flat rate or one-time settlement to buy out his portion of the group, but otherwise we may never get a Destiny's Child reunion because none of them want him to benefit financially,' the source concluded. Destiny's Child made their debut in 1998 with their self-titled release. The group then consisted of Beyoncé, Kelly, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. In 1999, Mathew kicked out LaTavia and LeToya and replaced them with Michelle and a short-lived member Farrah Franklin (she barely lasted three months) before settling in as a trio. They would release four additional albums; win three Grammy Awards and go on to sell more than 60 million records worldwide.

{"document": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescuers in Nepal have pulled a man from the wreckage of a building where he was stuck for a staggering 82 hours after the devastating earthquake that hit the country Saturday. His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

{"document": "Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya (CNN)At first glance, Sudan looks like any other northern white rhino: stout and agile, with square lips. He grazes under the hot sun, his massive head lowered to the ground,  at  the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya. When he's not wallowing in his enclosure, he waddles around the sprawling savannah, stopping briefly to drink water from a concrete hole. But Sudan is not just any rhino. He's the last known male northern white rhino left in the entire world. For an animal on the verge of extinction, the fate of the subspecies rests on his ability to conceive with the two female northern white rhinos at the conservancy. Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct. The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs. In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching. The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos. At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25. Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy. \"Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female,\" he says. In addition, he has a low sperm count, which complicates natural and scientific efforts, experts say. Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male. \"There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions,\" Paul says. \"Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded.\" And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct. Rhinos on a plane: Life-saving mission across borders . In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies. The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say. A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization. \"In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising,\" Paul says. \"However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward.\" Bringing rhinos back to Uganda, one calf at a time . The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire. \"Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future,\" Paul says. \"This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen.\" The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year. In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction. There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild. A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic.

Dr Fredric Brandt (left) has a striking resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly devastated by the portrayal . Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show. A friend speaking People said: 'It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying. '...It wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. It definitely hurt him. He was absolutely upset, who would want that? But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help. Another source, speaking to the New York Daily News, said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients. The source said: 'He worked 15-hour days, his office was jam-packed, and I paid him a compliment. He was so sensitive he started to cry. He said how awful the public was, and how mean people are. He was really affected by negative feedback.' When DailyMail.com asked Richmond about Brandt's death near his home in New York City's Upper West Side, he said he hadn't been aware of it. He said: 'That's very sad. I don't know anything about it. I just got home. Tina might know, I don't. She's not home.' Brandt was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry, with high-profile stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Kelly Ripa. The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami where he lived alone with his dogs. A male friend who was staying at the home out of concern for the doctor called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. He had last seen Brandt on the Saturday night. The police report stated that the victim was suffering from depression and was currently taking medication for it. He had also been seeking daily treatment from a psychiatrist.

Fifteen years ago, Jennifer Lopez' shimmering, navel-baring Versace gown captivated the world. So much so that, long before Kim Kardashian was breaking the internet, J Lo's 2000 red carpet appearance set the web ablaze. It even caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt, who has revealed that the plunging dress was his inspiration for creating Google Images. 'When Google was launched, people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer,' he told project-syndicate.com.

'At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen. 'But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J Lo wearing that dress. Google Image Search was born.'

This meant they first had to click on these links before finding out if J Lo's dress was featured. When Google Images was launched in July 2001, the site offered access to 250 million images. Just ten year later, that figure reached more than 10 billion. The dress is one of the few articles of specific clothing to be honoured its own Wikipedia page. After hearing the news, the 45-year-old singer shared an old picture of her in that dress on Instagram. She added: 'WHO KNEW!! #onepersoncanchangetheworld #onedresscanchangetheworld #jlo+versace=history #positivechange #funfacts LOL' The dress caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt (pictured), who recently revealed that it was his inspiration for creating Google Images . Google has big plans for its image search. A team of Google researchers recently developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called GoogLeNet, which is twice as effective than previous programs. It is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo. The software recently placed first in the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC). Google has made the software open to other developers, to help increase its accuracy, and in the future, the technology could be used to improve Google Image searches. It could also scour YouTube videos for specific objects or shapes. He may have helped to build the internet, but Dr Vinton ‘Vint’ Cerf has urged computer users to print out their most treasured photographs, or risk losing them. The Google vice president warned that as operating systems and software become more sophisticated, documents and images stored using older technology will become increasingly inaccessible. He went on to say that our dependence on technology could lead to the 21st century being a new dark age in history, with any evidence of our culture lost in a digital 'black hole'. In centuries to come, future historians looking back on the current era could be confronted by a digital desert comparable with the dark ages - the post-Roman period in Western Europe about which relatively little is known because of the scarcity of written records. Dr Cerf, who also has the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, said: ‘If we’re thinking 1,000 years, 3,000 years ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create? ‘We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it.'", "summary": "The now 45-year-old singer wore the dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards .\n'It was the most popular search query we had ever seen,' said Schmidt .\nIt inspired Google to launch Image Search so people could find it easier .\nPreviously users had to search through pages of text broken up by links ."}
{"document": "Second child: Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrives yesterday . A top executive at Goldman Sachs secretly filmed colleagues to record their ‘sexist’ behaviour when she became pregnant. Sonia Pereiro-Mendez says she was denied millions in pay and bonuses when she announced she was expecting her first child. Male colleagues at the bank were promoted ahead of her and she was ‘mocked’ and subjected to ‘gratuitous derogatory’ comments about her childcare arrangements, she alleges. So in an attempt to prove her claim, she recorded managers at the global investment firm ‘without their knowledge’, a tribunal heard yesterday. The executive director in distressed investing – which concerns companies in financial difficulties – is suing her employer for sex and maternity discrimination. She has also lodged a claim against three senior bosses – Bryan Mix, the global head of loan trading, Nicholas Pappas, who is European head of distressed trading, and Simon Morris, global head of credit trading. Yesterday Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrived with her second child for the first day of the hearing at Central London Employment Tribunal, which was told she would need breaks during proceedings to breastfeed. The hearing was not told who was recorded by Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, although they are likely to be among the 15 or so witnesses due to be called during the tribunal. The revelation was made by the bank’s counsel Daniel Stilitz QC, who said: ‘One key point is that... the claimant recorded some of the managers without their knowledge.’ Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, who speaks fluent German and Spanish, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 and moved to London in 2005 after a stint in Frankfurt. But over a five-year period she claims her income took a hit because bosses ‘felt, given her pregnancy, she was no longer a significant long-term player’. Her basic salary was £250,000 in January 2010 but by January 2012 – two months after announcing her pregnancy – it had fallen to £192,000. She was also entitled to a bonus of about five per cent of the profit she generated. But in 2011 she received £200,000 rather than the £910,000 she claims she was owed. Goldman Sachs executive Sonia Pereiro-Mendez  claims after she became pregnant she was cheated out of millions of pounds . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez claims men were promoted ahead of her at the bank (pictured) while she was ‘publicly mocked,’ and subjected to ‘gratuitous and implicitly derogatory references to her childcare arrangements' Mrs Pereiro-Mendez says her bonuses and salary were cut over five years . The following year she was paid £284,000 but says she should have got a further £475,000. By 2014 there was no bonus at all, although she says she should have been given £450,000. In her claim, she says she took ‘exceptional measures’ to perform her work during maternity leave. She would attend meetings, on one occasion asking in-laws to look after the child in a car park – enabling her to ‘swiftly breastfeed her baby during breaks’. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix all deny the allegations against them . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez has accused her former manager, Allen Ukritnukun, of excluding her from meetings, claiming he ‘publicly mocked’ her before male peers ‘for no good reason’. He also allegedly ‘made overt sexist comments’, which once amounted to ‘explicit sexual harrassment’. Mr Ukritnukun was later promoted to managing director, enabling him to become ‘emboldened in his contemptuous conduct’. Mr Ukritnukun vehemently denies the allegations made against him by Ms Pereiro-Mendez and is particularly distressed by the allegation that he made a comment which amounted to sexual harassment. She also says Mr Pappas made ‘overtly discriminatory comments’ during a business trip to Germany. Mr Morris said in a statement last month that her 2011 bonus was hit partly because of her involvement in ‘significant losses’. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix deny the allegations. The case continues.

{"document": "(CNN)Lest we Americans forget that -- in the wellsprings of our nation -- France bore the torch of liberty alongside us, our old ally has launched a reminder from across the Atlantic's waves. L'Hermione, with three sail masts and bright royal blue and gold markings, is a painstaking replica of an 18th century French frigate that fought with the United States' founding fathers in the War of Independence. It set sail in France on Saturday for Virginia to retrace a journey through American history. In 1780, the original Hermione was assigned to a French nobleman, who fought as a general in George Washington's army against the British. His name: Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette carried prized cargo -- news from King Louis XVI that France was throwing men, guns and treasure behind the Colonies, according to a historical summary on L'Hermione's website.  Lafayette, who had been wounded in the Revolutionary War had gone back to his homeland to lobby on behalf of Washington, who was also one of his close friends. Lafayette rejoined the fight on the front lines in Virginia, while L'Hermione did sea battle with its 32 guns against the English farther north. Its coppered bottom was an innovation that made it cut faster through the waters. In Chesapeake Bay, it joined the blockade that led the British to surrender. After the war, Lafayette returned to live in France. More than 200 years later, in 1997, a group of people came up with the idea of reconstructing the frigate using the same building methods applied in the original. They claim the replica is the \"most authentically built Tall Ship in the last 150 years.\" After a year of testing, it set sail Saturday to retrace Lafayette's journey, 235 years after the original, and France gave it a sendoff with the trappings of an act of state. \"L'Hermione is a luminous episode of our history. She is a champion of universal values, freedom, courage and of the friendship between France and the United States,\" French President Francois Hollande said in a speech. President Obama, in a letter to congratulate the launch, called France \"our Nation's oldest ally.\" \"For more than two centuries, the United States and France have stood united in the freedom we owe to one another,\" he wrote. L'Hermione will ply across the Atlantic for 27 days en route to Yorktown, Virginia, where it plans to arrive in early June. After that, it will show itself off in 12 ports along the East Coast. It should be in New York City for the Fourth of July, possibly sharing Independence Day fireworks with the Statue of Liberty. Since 1886, that gift from France -- also a reminder of our common bond -- has been America's quintessential national symbol of freedom.", "summary": "L'Hermione is a painstaking replica of an 18th century ship of the same name .\nThe original fought with American colonists against the British in the Revolutionary War ."}
{"document": "Arrest: Timothy Rogalski allegedly repeatedly called Sandy Hook Elementary School on Tuesday . A man has been arrested for repeatedly calling Sandy Hook Elementary School and accusing staff members of staging the 2012 school massacre. Timothy Rogalski, from Wallingford, Connecticut, called the school on Tuesday morning and left four messages on its office answerphone. The fifth time he called, he spoke to an administrative assistant. In the calls, the 30-year-old accused staff of being behind the December 14, 2012 shooting that left 20 children and six female educators dead, according to police in Monroe. He also said the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2014 were fake, police said. Authorities traced the calls back to the home Rogalski shares with his father, about 40 miles from where the 2012 attack unfolded, and he was arrested. 'I don't think I said anything that horrible,' Rogalski said at a court appearance on Wednesday, NBC Connecticut reported. He has been charged with harassment and disorderly conduct and is being held on $2,500 bond. He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and not to contact anyone at the school. He will next appear in court on April 22. Arrest: The calls were traced to his home in Wallingford, pictured, which is about 40 miles from where the shooting unfolded in Newtown in 2012. He was taken into custody and charged . Rogalski allegedly made the calls to Sandy Hook Elementary, which is operating temporarily in Monroe as a new school is built to replace the old one, and two other nearby schools. The original site of the school was demolished a year after the shootings. The gunman's home, where he shot dead his mother before going on the killing spree at the school, was also torn down in earlier this year. Rogalski's arrest does not mark the first time threatening calls have been made about the killings. In the days following the 2012 school shooting, Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 31, looked up Newtown residents' phone numbers from his home in Venezuela and made more than 90 calls. Authorities said that in a few calls, Cardenas claimed to be the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, and threatened to kill the person he had phoned. Terror: Responders gather at the scene of the mass school shooting in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The shooting left 20 children and six educators dead, as well as the gunman's mother . 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna (expletive) kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead,' he said, according to authorities. Deirdre Daly, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said the conduct of Cardenas was reprehensible. 'These threatening calls, just two days after the tragedy, compounded the collective suffering of all of the citizens of Newtown and needlessly stressed law enforcement resources at a critical time,' she said.

{"document": "Five days before college sweethearts Brittany Huber and John Redman were to wed last May, a horrific car crash on a Georgia highway killed the young bride and left her fiance clinging to life. Redman survived, but his body was left shattered and he was told by his doctors that he was likely to spend the rest of his life in a nursing home, confined to a wheelchair. The future looked bleak for the 25-year-old assistant basketball coach at Dalton State College, but against overwhelming odds Redman recovered, and on March 24 he helped lead his team to a championship title. Tragic couple: Brittany Huber and John Redman were involved in a deadly car crash just days before their wedding last spring. The bride to be was killed on impact and the groom was left clinging to life . Bittersweet moment: Eleven months later, Redman, assistant basketball coach at Dalton State College, helped lead his team to its very first championship title. Sadly, Huber was not there to celebrate with Redman . Victory: The Dalton Roadrunners beat Westmont College of California 71-53 in Kansas City on March 24 - 11 months after Redman's (third from the right) accident . 'To me, it was almost a relief,' Redman told Al.com of the win - the team's first since it has become eligible to take part in the championship. 'I had such a long year personally. ... It was very emotional in more ways than anybody could understand.' But for Redman, standing on the court in Kansas City and celebrating the Dalton Roadrunners' first-ever NAIA championship victory - they beat Westmont College of California 71-53 - was a bittersweet moment because his biggest cheerleader, Brittany, was not there. 'Now I realize more and more each day what I learned from her and what I learned from that whole situation so yea, good things can happen from bad things,' he said. The past 11 months have been the most challenging in John Redman's life. On April 28, 2014, Redman was driving his future wife from Dalton, Georgia, to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama, when he lost control of his Lexus in a rainstorm. The car blew a tire, hydroplaned and smashed into a bridge column on Interstate 85 in Merriweather County, Georgia, killing the 23-year-old bride in impact. Inseparable: The couple had been together since 2011 and were just five days from their wedding . Wreckage: They were driving from Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama when Redman lost control of his car and smashed into the median, killing his fiancee on impact . 'I don't remember the accident at all,' Redman told 11 Alive. The young basketball coach was rushed to a hospital and spent more than two weeks in a coma with five broken ribs, three surgically removed ribs, 21 skull fractures and eight broken teeth. 'They [doctors] told my parents I'd be in assisted living the rest of my life... that I'd never come back to work. I'd be in a wheelchair. I might never talk again,' Redman recalled. After a month in the hospital, Redman finally asked to see Brittany for the first time since the accident. 'I was mad at her because she hadn't come to visit me. I'm in the hospital, she hasn't visited me one time,' he said. That is when Huber's parents broke the devastating news to Redman that his wife-to-be didn't make it. Redman and Huber had been together since the fall of 2011, and the couple got engaged in June 2013. In July of that year, then-23-year-old graduate of Spring Hill College was hired as assistant men's basketball coach at Dalton State. His fiancee worked as a kindergarten teacher’s aide at City Park Elementary School. Huber had a severe hearing impairment since she was a girl, but her students and people who met her for the first time often couldn’t pick up on it because of her uncanny ability to read lips . Hanging by a thread: Redman survived the crash but was left with a cracked skull and broken ribs, and was told he would likely spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. For the first month in the hospital, he had no idea that Huber has died . Miracle: Against overwhelming odds, Redman recovered and was able to walk out of the hospital and resume coaching (pictured) On the eve of their fateful road trip to Mobile, Brittany wrote on her Instagram page: ‘I can't wait to ride on this journey with him and see what our amazing God has in store for us.’ Just hours before her death, Huber posted a photo of their journey, with the caption: 'It is finally wedding week!' The church where the couple were due to marry on May 3 was instead the venue for her memorial service. Seven women wore matching mint green dresses - their bridesmaids dresses - to the service,AL.com reported at the time. John Redman says he felt Brittany's presence in the hospital every day, as always cheering him on. 'I felt Brittany was there the whole time, and she was telling me to get up, get out, you don't want to be here, go live your life,' he recalled. And that is exactly what Redman did, to the surprise of his doctors who called his recovery a miracle. Back on the court: Redman (far right) started out slowly, working part-time at Dalton a couple of hours a day . Smiling again: Redman said that working with the team, including assistant men's basketball coach Tony Ingle Jr (left), was a form of therapy for him . 'When you hear a doctor say you're a miracle, you probably are a miracle, they don't use that world very easily or lightly,’ he told WRCB. After weeks of physical therapy, Redman resumed coaching. He started out slowly, working part-time a couple of hours a day and using his time with the team as a form of therapy. 'Just having something to look forward to, and something to do, it's given me hope, made me excited again. They saved my life,' Redman said.

Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers because of restrictions that will squeeze profits. The company has also warned existing customers that the loyalty points they earn will be much lower from June 1. Financial experts believe other firms are likely to follow suit. Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers after the announcement of an EU cap limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments (file photo) The company scrapped the deal after the announcement last month of an EU cap – due to be introduced in October – limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments. Capital One said it made perks 'no longer sustainable'. Kevin Mountford, of price comparison website MoneySupermarket, told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is a classic case of regulators, in this case European, trying to act with the consumer in mind, only for the policy to come back to bite the very people it was supposed to help. 'Its new rules won't just hit cashback cards, all loyalty programmes are at risk because something will have to give when card companies are squeezed.' Last month, the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. The cap will apply to all purchases paid for with a card in the EU – either abroad or on the internet. Several credit card companies – including American Express, Barclaycard, and Santander – have millions of customers who earn hundreds of pounds or free flights if they clear their debts every month.

It said it would not be increasing fees or charges as a result of the changes. Rachel Springall, of financial information website Moneyfacts, said: 'The changes from Capital One could be the starting point for a change to reward schemes because of the new ruling on interchange fees.

{"document": "Nico Rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career. Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock, he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton: ‘I know exactly how he is functioning. I understand him really, really well. All his attitudes. I can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing. Sometimes he annoys me. Some character traits.’ Go on, then, tell us what it is that gets under your skin. Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday . Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton . Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign . ‘I don’t want to give details,’ says Rosberg, diplomatic to the core. At this point the door of the Mercedes hospitality area, in which Rosberg and I are sitting alone, opens fast and loudly. It is Hamilton invading the quiet of the interview. He turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut, his head down, and shouts in an almost childlike way: ‘Phew, phew, man, it’s hot,’ deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke. ‘You see...?’ says Rosberg, his eyebrows arched. The daunting task he faces against his extraordinary team-mate was made vividly clear under the lights in qualifying for Sunday’s Bahrain Grand Prix. Not only will he start behind Hamilton for the fourth consecutive race but behind the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, who is emerging as a putative title contender. ROSBERG'S CORNER . Keke Rosberg . The 1982 world champion attended pre-season testing with friends but rarely goes to races and does not give interviews. Nico said he got his father’s advice before the last race in Abu Dhabi but he generally gives his son space. Vivian Rosberg . Nico’s long-term girlfriend turned wife. She attends a few races, sometimes with a clutch of their long-standing friends, but is happy in the background. She works as an interior designer. Georg Nolte . A popular, mild-mannered former Bild sports journalist, who is Nico’s PR and Man Friday. Tony Ross . Rosberg’s race engineer. His attachment to Rosberg is such that he moved from Williams to Mercedes at the driver’s request. HAMILTON'S CORNER . Anthony Hamilton . Father is rarely seen at races since being dropped as Lewis’s manager but he is still the family patriarch. He established the business side of his son’s career and still controls elements of it. Niki Lauda . The Mercedes chairman is strictly neutral but has a vested interest in Hamilton being successful, having brought him to the team after telling the board he was the driver who could win them the title. Daniel ‘Spinz’ Forrest . Hamilton’s new travelling companion. A music producer, he looks after Hamilton’s social media output. Peter Bonnington . Hamilton’s race engineer. He did the same job for Michael Schumacher. Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday. He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points. But even more separates them as people. Rosberg grew up the son of privilege. His father, Keke, was 1982 world champion. He was brought up in Monaco. He attended a smart international school there. He speaks five languages. But his life is the quiet life. Not for him the Hamilton whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in Los Angeles. He is not tattooed from chest to leg. While Hamilton courts fame, Rosberg’s dream evening finishes with him and wife, Vivian, staying in to watch an ‘educational documentary’, their yellow Labrador, Bailey, at their side. Family is important. He has known Vivian, an interior designer, since his teenage years. They make smoothies or ‘healthy’ pancakes when they home in Monaco or Ibiza. They gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden. He relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch. He loves his classic car — a light blue Mercedes 280SL Pagoda, as perfect as the day it was made in 1970. He bought it without Vivian knowing, but they both enjoy it now. He drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern France. Rosberg has a trait rare among modern Formula One drivers: a hinterland. He turned down a place at Imperial College to become a full-time racing driver. If he wins the World Championship this year he will do so with a book under his arm. He is the driver who never stops learning. Having married last year, he and Vivian are expecting their first child in August, during the sport’s summer break. ‘Typical German precision,’ he jokes. ‘I’m very excited and very lucky,’ he says. ‘I just hope it all goes well. There is a link between your personal life and your racing life, naturally.’ But we know he is a nice, intelligent chap, more settled in life than his rival. The point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity — the skill and cutting edge — to beat such an extravagant talent as Hamilton, who eclipsed him last year. Rosberg has failed to match Hamilton this season, raising the question whether he will go the way of Mark Webber, who fell away after making his Red Bull team-mate Vettel fight him for his first title. Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second in qualifying on Saturday . Jenson Button will start his 100th race for McLaren from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying. It was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure, the latest coming just four corners into his first lap. ‘It was a power cut,’ said Button. ‘I don’t know where it came from.' It is Rosberg who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later — and always turns up on time, unlike Hamilton — but genius sometimes makes its own rules. Raw talent is outstripping endeavour. As a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on Friday, he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in. He arrived after a brief stop in Dubai, relaxing and training, before heading to the track to face an inquisition. Why had he criticised Hamilton for slowing down seven days ago in China and thus imperilling Mercedes’ one-two finish? Rosberg answered in a relaxed and courteous manner. ‘Only today have there been millions of questions,’ he tells me once the wider interrogation was over. ‘Other than that I’ve had some distance from it all. I don’t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine. For both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic. Hamilton and Rosberg pose together during their unveiling as Mercedes' new team in February 2013 . ‘Lewis and I are going through a difficult period. We cannot totally be friends. We go through ups and downs. We are only speaking when we need to but sometimes we have a laugh together. We have so much to do with each other. We karted together. We are here together. I am not an ice man, either. Things can get to me but I do not get angry. I am rational. You won’t catch me getting very emotional.’ The feud between the two has been running for a year, each upsetting the other in turn, a situation magnified because there has been nobody else with whom to scrap. If Ferrari seriously push their way into the championship contest, that might change somewhat. ‘There are so many experiences that I can build on,’ says Rosberg. ‘Even now when he has taken quite a few points off me and been on a winning streak, I think back to last year when I had my best run after he had won four in a row. Nico's father Keke (left) was also a famous racing driver and won the 1982 Formula One World Championship . ‘I like to push myself. I am not at my peak as a driver, though I am probably close to it. But I have the experience of how to set up the car and deal with the whole world of Formula One. The intra-team stuff, personal relations are helped by last year. It was so valuable.’ Rosberg was born 29 years ago in Wiesbaden, Germany to a German mother, Sina, and his famous Finnish father. He soon moved to Monaco and developed as European polyglot. His solid family background is the bedrock of his life. Hamilton said last year that Rosberg was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds, the former being from a council estate in Stevenage and the latter from a plutocrat’s playground. Fair? ‘I had it easy if you think of people who have money struggles in their lives. People reading this may think I had it easy. But I had my personal battles. Even making it to Formula One was not easy; it was a constant challenge and commitment. My whole life has taken a lot of sacrifice. ‘Some people say I am not strong enough to beat Lewis but I have as much belief as ever. I only wouldn’t believe I could beat him if I got to the end of the championship and I had lost. That is not what I want to happen and I am constantly learning to make sure it’s not what happens.’ Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel pipped Rosberg to second in qualifying on Saturday .", "summary": "Lewis Hamilton qualified in pole position for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix .\nFerrari's Sebastian Vettel pipped Mercedes' Nico Rosberg to second .\nRosberg's father Keke was 1982 world champion .\nRosberg and his wife Vivian are expecting their first child in August .\nWhile Hamilton courts fame and has a lavish lifestyle, Rosberg's focus is on his family while his life is more settled ."}
{"document": "They are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across America, prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on Earth they could mean and where they are pointing to. But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington, Washington County, Utah . The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments . The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail . Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda, Humboldt County . Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route . One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco . The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad . Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada . Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains . In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow . A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War . At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by . 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us. 'Before our research we knew nothing about airways, beacons or concrete arrows, it has been a marvelous journey of discovery and we cannot believe that all of this has been \"forgotten.\"'.", "summary": "Hikers often stumble upon the unusual concrete markers and wonder why they were built .\nThe arrows directed the first air mail planes across the US to deliver post .\nThey lay at the bottom of lit beacons and showed pilots the direction to fly in to arrive at the next air field .\nWhile they are no longer used, many lie forgotten until they are found by arrow-hunting fans ."}
{"document": "Team Sky's Geraint Thomas had to settle for 14th place in an incident-packed Tour of Flanders as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff took victory in a sprint finish with Holland's Niki Terpstra. With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff . Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014.", "summary": "Norway's Alexander Kristoff won race after sprint finish with Niki Terpstra .\nGeraint Thomas was among favourites to claim title following recent win .\nThe Welshman was unable to recover ground on Kristoff and Terpstra ."}

{"document": "Sending post to space is problematic, so when a teenager from Houston, Texas, wanted to send a message to her astronaut father, she had to be creative. 13-year-old Stephanie decided that long-distance phone calls weren't enough and she wanted to given her father a visual note of how much she missed him while he was away. The next time the NASA employee was up in space, she decided to create a huge art project in the desert that he would be able to see from the International Space Station. The message 13-year-old Stephanie wrote to her father in Nevada’s Delamar Dry Lake . Her father is a keen photographer and likes to take pictures of the earth when he is floating in space. Stephanie thought she could use his hobby to send him a message from back on earth. She enlisted the help of car manufacturer Hyundai to make the earth drawing, that has now broken a world record for its size. The car company used eleven sedans to draw the message on the land in Nevada’s Delamar Dry Lake, that read ‘Steph [hearts] you!’ using coordinates and a helicopter. Stephanie drew the note on paper and worked with Hyundai to get it copied onto a large land surface . 11 cars wrote the message in the dusty land in Nevada’s Delamar Dry Lake using coordinates and a helicopter.

{"document": "They're the fastest-growing nutrition bar in the U.S. with sales topping $100 million. But the FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be. Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled 'healthy' - brimming with fiber, protein and antioxidants, while being low in fat and sodium. However, upon closer inspection, it was found that 'none of the products met the requirements to make such content claims' and were in fact 'misbranded'. Mislabeled? The FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be . Indeed, Daily Mail Online calculated that one KIND bar flavor - not included in the FDA investigation - contains more calories, fat and sodium than a Snickers bar. A 40g Honey Smoked BBQ KIND Bar - marketed as 'bold and all-natural' - contains 230 calories, 16gms of fat and 125mgs of sodium. Meanwhile, an equivalent serving of Snickers contains 190 calories, 9gms of fat and 91mgs of sodium. In response, a spokesperson for KIND highlighted that nuts are to blame for the imbalance. 'Nuts, key ingredients in many of our snacks and one of the things that make fans love our bars, contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA’s standard. 'This is similar to other foods that do not meet the standard for use of the term healthy, but are generally considered to be good for you like avocados, salmon and eggs.'. However, New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle told Today.com that said the problem is not nuts and it's the 'hidden' sugary ingredients that have to change. KIND Bar: Honey Smoked BBQ (40g) Calories: 230 . Fat: 16gm . Sodium:125mg . Protein: 10g . Snickers Bar (40g) Calories: 190 . Fat: 9gm . Sodium: 91mg . Protein: 3g . 'KIND bars are candy bars making health claims, and thereby marketing them as healthy snacks,'  Nestle said. The four KIND bars highlighted in the FDA case include the Almond & Apricot, Almond & Coconut, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate  and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew. On April 14 KIND posted a note on its website stating that it was 'moving quickly to comply' with the FDA's request. 'We're also taking it upon ourselves to conduct a thorough review of all of our snack food labels and website information to ensure that they're compliant,' the message continued. While labeling readjustments will be made to certain bars, KIND reassures fans that recipes will remain the same. It added: 'We couldn’t be more proud of our snack foods and their nutritional benefits. 'Our entire line of delicious snacks made with high quality ingredients like whole grains, nuts and seeds will continue to be available wherever KIND is sold.' KIND bars,  the brainchild of New York salesman Daniel Lubetzky, first hit the market in 2004. The clear-packaged snacks quickly became a hit with consumers and sales soared from $15 million in 2008 to nearly $120 million in 2012, according to Fortune. In a bid to expand into the health food market further, Lubetzky came up with a granola-like cereal called 'healthy grain clusters'..

{"document": "Shanghai, China (CNN)Volvo says it will begin exporting vehicles made in a factory in southwest China to the United States next month, the first time Chinese-built passenger cars will roll into American showrooms. Parent company Geely Automobile, which bought Volvo in 2010, is seeking to prove that a Chinese company can manage a global auto brand. Geely's gambit will be watched to see if it paves the way for other Chinese car manufacturers to crack developed markets. CEO Håkan Samuelsson said Volvo planned to sell 1,500 Chinese-made S60 Inscription sedans in 2015 and 5,000 annually in subsequent years. For many U.S. consumers, China is still more closely linked with cheap clothing and electronics than luxury vehicles, but Samuelsson downplayed any concerns about quality. \"We don't highlight where the vehicle is built but we don't keep it a secret. We sell them as Volvos and we know they are exactly the same in quality no matter where they are produced,\" he told CNN. The car will be one of four models produced in a manufacturing plant in Chengdu that opened in 2013. But given that Volvo's brand is staked on its reputation for safety, analysts said the company will have to tread carefully. \"They have a strong enough reputation no matter where they're made. They will have to make sure they don't ruin that perception with any quality issues,\" said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultants Bain & Company. China surpassed the U.S. as the largest market for car sales globally in 2009, and most major automakers build cars in China. But until now those cars have been sold almost exclusively in China. Chinese car manufacturers like Geely and its rival Great Wall Motor do export their models to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But none have so far dared tackle developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe. Geely chairman Li Shufu said he hoped the company would eventually become a global car brand, but said there were no current plans to begin export its home-grown brand to U.S. showrooms. \"We have the ambition, yes; determination yes, but I'm also [a] very realistic person,\" he said. Industry analysts say it's unlikely we will see Chinese car makers shake up the U.S. car market in the same way Japanese and South Korean manufacturers did decades earlier, at least in the near future. \"Hyundai and Toyota are now extremely successful but it took them decades to move away from being perceived as lower end and lower quality than U.S. cars,\" said Tsang. \"And now the market is even more competitive, especially for entry level models.\" READ MORE: China wants eyes on cars not models at Shanghai Auto Show .", "summary": "Volvo says it will begin exporting Chinese-built cars to the U.S. in May .\nIt's the first time \"Made in China\" cars will be available in U.S. showrooms .\nBut it's unlikely that Chinese car brands will take on developed markets ."}
{"document": "Bearing in mind he’s a dog, Don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway. To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls . The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks . Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire. Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour . The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow . Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm . Remarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. ‘He didn’t even bark,’ Mr Hamilton said. Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls. ‘So far people seem to find it amusing,’ Mr Hamilton said. ‘But I think Don’s driving days are over.’ Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012 .", "summary": "The bizarre incident happened on M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire .\nSheepdog leaned on controls of tractor taking it from a field on to the road .\nIncident caused tailbacks as police and the farmer recovered the vehicle .\nDon's owner Tom Hamilton was tending to a lamb when drama unfolded ."}
{"document": "Five staff members sustained serious injuries after taking a joy ride down 'the Super Slide' at the Sydney Royal Easter Show on Saturday night, despite the slide being closed after heavy rain made it too dangerous. It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation.

{"document": "The eye is one of the most complex yet delicate part of the human body. Now engineers claim to have designed a range of synthetic eyes that may one day let us replace and even enhance our own sense of vision. Italian bio-designers MHOX has unveiled project is has been working on to 3D print organic tissues to produce working body parts that can replace the eyes of people suffering from disease. It could mean rather than getting glasses to correct their vision, people would be able to replace their entire eye. The MHOX Eye concept (above) is designed to replace and even enhance the vision compared to a normal eye . The group plan to combine the biological tissue with microscopic wireless technology to provide additional functions and give super human eyesight. While currently still just a concept, the project raises the prospect of what bio-engineering may make possible in years to come. The team behind MHOX say their synthetic eyes, which include lenses that improves the image sharpness and can put filters over the vision, could be available by 2027. Scientists claim to have made a 'giant leap' towards creating 3D organs that could be simply printed out in hospitals when needed for a transplant. An international team have created the first organs that include a full vascular network for transporting blood through organs. They say it could even allows organs damaged by cancer to simply replaced. Scientists from the Universities of Sydney, Harvard, Stanford and MIT have now bio-printed artificial vascular networks mimicking the body's circulatory system that are necessary for growing large complex tissues. Using a high-tech 'bio-printer', the researchers fabricated a multitude of interconnected tiny fibres to serve as the mold for the artificial blood vessels. They then covered the 3D printed structure with a cell-rich protein-based material, which was solidified by applying light to it. Lastly they removed the bio-printed fibres to leave behind a network of tiny channels coated with human endothelial cells, which self organised to form stable blood capillaries in less than a week. Filippo Nassetti and Alessandro Zomparelli, the two Italian designers leading the project, said: 'Latest developments in bioprinting and biohacking let us imagine that in the near future it would be possible to easily print organic, functional body parts, allowing the human to replace defected districts or enhance standard performance. 'This project is based on the idea of augmenting the sight sense, increasing the functionalities of the eye with ones currently handled by other body segments or external devices.' Under MHOX designs, patients with eye disease will inthe future be able to replace their eye with a synthetic one printed in a laboratory. For those looking to improve their vision, they could buy the 'Enhance' model that features a 'hyper retina' to give 15/10 vision - significantly better than normal 20/20 vision. They say it could also include a gland that can filter the visual signal to the brain by producing vintage or black and white effects much like a modern camera. They say these could be turned on or off by swallowing a pill that alters the state of this gland. The Eye Advance model adds a wifi connection that allows what the eye is seeing to be recorded and shared with others. It could also connect to external devices to act like a camera. They say a socket that connects the eye to the brain - which would require a surgical operation - would allow eyes to be interchangable. The synthetic eyes would come in three different models (above) according to the designs outlined by MHOX . MHOX propose combining new technology like Wifi with bioprinting to produce an enhanced bionic eye . The concept sounds a little like something out of the science fiction hit Blade Runner where bioengineers built new eyes for robotic replicants. Writing on their website, Mr Nassetti and Mr Zomparelli said: 'The installation of the EYE augmentations needs a first surgical operation aimed at installing the Deck, the technology that actually connects the eye to the brain. 'After that, augmented eyes can be easily interchanged by their own users without the need of additional surgery. 'Besides allowing to use different augmentations in different contexts, this system is suitable for easy hardware upgrade.' The designers say 3D bioprinters could be used to create the tissues to create the complex eye stucture .", "summary": "Italian designers have unveiled a concept for a bio-printed synthetic eye .\nThey say enhanced retina could increase vision to make images sharper .\nFiltering signals to the brain to produce vintage or black and white effects .\nCurrently just a concept, the designers say it could be available by 2027 ."}
{"document": "A young fashion designer who needed 26 stitches to her face after it was allegedly smashed into a glass table-top by a police officer is suing him and his force for $4million. Ariana Mason, 21, claims she was also choked by the man when he put her in a 'stranglehold' at a Las Vegas hotel. After filing a civil rights lawsuit against Officer Shawn Izzo and the Metropolitan Police Department,, she told reporters yesterday: 'What happened to me was wrong and I don't want it to happen to anybody else.' Scroll down for video . Tearful: Ariana Mason, 21, relives her ordeal to reporters yesterday. Scars said to be from the attack on her by a police officer last summer can be seen on her chin. Two of her teeth were also broken, she says . Ariana was flanked by her parents, Fred and Francina Mason of Teaneck, New Jersey, plus an aunt from Los Angeles - TV personality Rolonda Watts - and her lawyer Brent Bryson as she relived her ordeal. It was caught on CCTV cameras at The Mirage hotel casino on Las Vegas's strip. According to Ariana's lawsuit, she was subjected to excessive force at the hotel while she was being arrested shortly before 3am on August 16 last year. The lawsuit also noted that Ariana is African-American and Izzo is white. Ariana, who cried while talking to reporters yesterday, told them: 'I just feel as if the color of my skin was different, this wouldn't have happened to me.' Sombre: Ariana looks on as her lawyer holds up a photograph from last August of her battered face . Lawyer Brent Bryson said his young client had 26 stitches after her face was rammed into a glass table-top . Ariana Mason's aunt is Rolonda Watts, the television and radio talk show host. She is best known for hosting the eponymous Rolonda, an internationally syndicated talk show which aired from 1994 to 1997 . With scars clearly visible on her chin, she recalled how she had been at an event at The Mirage's 1 Oak nightclub – where her boyfriend 'DJ Tech' was performing. After his set, several people left the club to take pictures in front of the event's signage, according to Ariana's account. But during the photo session, a scuffle broke out 'between people associated with the event and security officers'. Ariana, who was wearing a black dress at the time, claims one of her girlfriends was 'attacked' by a woman security officer. Ariana said she grabbed the woman's jacket to move her away. But then Ariana herself was 'attacked' by Officer Izzo, who approached her from behind. Without warning, she says, he pulled her away and wrapped his forearm around her throat. In the hotel's CCTV footage, Ariana can be seen being restrained by a police officer, said to be Shawn Izzo . Another camera shows the officer putting Ariana in a chokehold and dragging her across the floor . The young fashion designer said she 'became extremely anxious' and struggled to breathe during the 'attack' 'He then threw Ariana to the ground and maintained Ariana in a choke hold and actually drug Ariana by the neck across the floor outside of 1 Oak for several feet,' claims the lawsuit. The young woman, it says, 'became extremely anxious' as she struggled to breathe. After she broke free from his grip, she punched him. She said she had no idea he was a police officer because he hadn't identified himself to her. 'When he came behind me I didn't know who was attacking me from behind, and all I did was try to defend myself,' she added. 'I feel as if the way he reacted was completely unnecessary, and it shouldn't have happened like that. 'He should have had more control under the situation, instead of escalating it and making it ten times worse.' After breaking free from his grip she punched him (left) - but says she had no idea he was a police officer . Ariana's legs are seen around the officer's hips in the right of this video still as her face is pressed against the glass-topped table - upon which rests a giant vase of pink and yellow flowers . In the CCTV footage obtained by Ariana's lawyer, Officer Izzo and others are seen handcuffing her hands behind her back and leading her to a round, marble table with a glass top. She is made to bend over it, and her face is pushed against it several times by a man standing between her outstretched legs. At one point her legs end up around his waist while her head is pressed on the table. Her face was rammed so hard on to the glass that it shattered - and shards embedded in her chin. Two of her teeth were broken, too. A photo of her injuries was shown to reporters by Mr Bryson yesterday. He said his client had needed several operations to repair her face. He added: 'Once Ariana was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, she was not a threat.' Ariana cried throughout yesterday's appearance. She claims the color of her skin was a factor in the incident . Ariana had been charged with battery on a protected person but prosecutors dismissed the case last month. She filed an internal affairs complaint but police ratified Izzo's conduct. Records show that Ariana was one of two people arrested on felony battery on a police officer charges in the incident. Six others were arrested on misdemeanor charges. She admitted she was 20 at the time but said she had 'only two drinks' during the night out. She added that she hadn't been asked for ID when she arrived at the nightclub with her boyfriend. The club's operator has yet to comment.

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing £255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague ‘you wait til I road test this later.’ 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can’t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don’t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly £10,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as “appalling” and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic’s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner.

{"document": "A sheep farmer has won an apology from supermarket giant Asda after a leg of lamb she bought from them labelled as British turned out to be imported from the other side of the world. Sue Sharp was shocked to find a stamp on the £11 joint saying it had come from New Zealand despite Asda's packaging claiming it was born, reared and slaughtered in the UK. Mrs Sharp, who runs a 1,600-acre sheep farm with her husband Robert, had purposely sought out British produce in support of her fellow farmers. Misleading: The leg of lamb Sue Sharp bought from Asda in Midlothian, Scotland, claims on the packaging that it is from the UK. But a stamp on the meat (pictured) is from the New Zealand health inspector . But she was horrified when she got home and found the 'home-grown' leg of lamb had actually been flown halfway round the world to the store in Midlothian, Scotland. Asda said the mislabelled lamb was a one-off and that the gaffe was the result of human error. But Mrs Sharp has questioned the claim and is now warning other shoppers to be extra vigilant when choosing their joints of meat. The label on the Asda Butcher's Selection leg states it is 'Born in the UK. Reared in the UK. Slaughtered in the UK. Cut in the UK' but a stamp branded onto the animal's skin carries the stamp of the New Zealand health inspector. The error has been called 'unacceptable' by farming unions who are now demanding to meet with bosses at the supermarket chain to discuss their future plans for selling British lamb. Asda says it has carried out an investigation into the mistake which revealed Mrs Sharp's leg of lamb was the only one mislabelled at the Galashiels store she shopped at. Sue Sharp, 57, has refused to accept Asda's explanation that the mistake was a one-off . Mrs Sharp, 57, whose farm has 1,300 sheep, said: 'As a sheep farmer I'm very interested in making sure I buy British meat. 'The lamb I bought from Asda was clearly labelled UK born, UK raised, UK slaughtered. 'It wasn't until I got home and looked at it more closely that I realised the stamp actually on the meat itself said New Zealand. 'It was a bit of a shock and something I feel rather strongly about as a sheep farmer - the last thing I want to do is buy New Zealand lamb. 'I was completely baffled so I wrote to Asda and they came back apologising but saying it was an isolated incident. 'I just don't believe that. I'm sure it was a mistake but I bet there were more, I can't see how just one could have been wrongly labelled.' She added: 'They've held their hands up but is that enough? A big company like Asda should have procedures in place to make that sort of error pretty much impossible to make. 'As farmers we have to deal with traceability. The form-filling is really onerous, and that needs to apply right the way through the chain. 'We are doing our part so you would have thought big companies should be able to do their part. 'I think British meat is a better product, it tastes better, but it's also much better for the environment than shipping it round the world. You couldn't get much farther away than New Zealand.' Mrs Sharp has now advised other people to check their meat thoroughly to make sure it is from where it says it is. John Armour from NFU Scotland said: 'For a sheep farmer like Mrs Sharp to have bought a product she thought would support her fellow British farmers only to discover that it was imported is unacceptable and Asda has acknowledged that. An Asda spokesman said: 'This was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled' It is estimated that more than 70 per cent of the New Zealand lamb sold in Britain comes from halal slaughterhouses without the fact being declared on the label. All the slaughtermen in these establishments must be Muslim and say a prayer when making the cut across the animal’s throat which kills it. The New Zealand meat industry has taken the step to ensure its lamb can be sold in Muslim markets round the world. In conventional slaughterhouses, animals are stunned before they are killed by having their throats cut. However, in most Muslim countries, halal means the animals must not be stunned first. 'Asda's planned review of practices at the Galashiels store is a sensible step and it would be prudent for guidance to be re-issued to its suppliers and all Asda stores across the country to avoid fresh meat being incorrectly labelled in the future. 'Shoppers who want to support British farmers need to be able to trust the labels used in every supermarket.' He added: 'Thankfully incidents of this kind are rare but the vigilance of Mrs Sharp has provided an excellent reminder to all retailers of the need for best practice and accurate labelling at all times. 'If it says Scottish or British on the label, it must be Scottish or British in the packet.' An Asda spokesman said: 'This was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled. 'We pride ourselves on product traceability and transparency and are committed to sourcing British products first when in season. 'This was a genuine colleague error for which we apologise and was not meant to mislead any of our customers in any way. 'We've briefed our colleagues at the Galashiels store to make sure this doesn't happen again.'", "summary": "Sue Sharp shocked to find 'home-grown' leg of lamb from New Zealand .\nShe refuses to accept Asda's explanation that it was a one-off mistake .\nThe sheep farmer has now warned shoppers to be extra vigilant ."}

The Kern County Jail website showed Whittington remained behind bars on Friday with bail set at $1 million. 'That was horrible, man,' owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral told the Daily News. Horrifying: Video shows the injured boy crying on the floor, then the man who may his father, yanking him up off the ground by his shirt . 'The worst thing I've ever seen,' he said of the incident at his establishment. Dindral says he was in the back of the store when his employee ran to him and told him to watch the surveillance video to see if there was any proof of the violent assault. Dindral later gave the footage to cops who were able to track down the suspect. 'It was the right thing to do,' Dindral told the Daily News. 'You don’t hit a child like that.' Local Tattoo artist Chris Danaher who works near the market said he could never fathom acting violently towards a child. 'I would never imagine treating a child like that,' Danaher told ABC. 'His wife or girlfriend or whatever was clearly pregnant. She had no regard to it. She picked up her son and left the store,' he added. Danher said sadly the child is too young to truly understand what is going on. 'It's terrible. That kid is obviously too young to know what was going on. Honestly, couldn't be more than 3 years old, and I just couldn't imagine anyone doing that to me or me doing that to a child whatsoever,' said Danaher. The boy was later examined by medical personnel at his home and he did not require hospitalization. It is unknown whether or not he will be placed in new custody. A second video released on Friday shows Whittington allegedly picking up his son like a rag doll. The potential child abuse case is currently under investigation.", "summary": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .\nJustin Whittington, 23, of Bakersfield, California was taken into custody on Thursday night on suspicion of child endangerment .\nWhittington was allegedly filmed hitting a toddler in the face so hard that he falls to the ground .\nWhittington is believed to be the boy's father ."}
{"document": "Rocker Richie Sambora is being investigated by police over claims he 'threatened to kill' his former fashion designer lover. The ex Bon Jovi guitarist, 55, allegedly told former business partner Nikki Lund he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her', Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. Sambora is said to have made the chilling threat during a blazing telephone argument on March 19. His shaken former flame decided to report the allegation to authorities a week later. Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

{"document": "Student demonstrators who walked on an American flag to protest racism sparked a countermovement, prompting a south Georgia university to cancel classes Friday ahead of a rally that drew hundreds to Valdosta. Valdosta State University found itself in the center of a controversy after a video shared on social media showed an Air Force veteran and former Playboy model, Michelle Manhart, taking an American flag from demonstrators who had walked on it to protest racism. At the protest, held a week ago, Manhart was detained by police when she refused to return the flag. Big rally: Flag supporters attend a rally on Friday in Valdosta, Georgia that caused the Valdosta State University to close down for the day . Closed: Uproar over a protest in which demonstrators walked on an American flag has prompted a south Georgia university to cancel classes ahead of the rally expected to draw crowds of flag supporters to Valdosta . Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia . Hunt: Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus . She later was banned from the campus of 11,500 students. She was not a student at Valdosta State, according to the school. The flag-walking demonstration involved three protesters, university spokesman Andy Clark said. Meanwhile, tensions rose at Valdosta State when campus police found a backpack containing a handgun on Tuesday. Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus. Sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities, Clark said. Flag supporters gathered for a rally Friday afternoon, and university administrators said the possibility of thousands of people rallying on the outskirts of campus ultimately led to the decision to give students a day off. 'That level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,' Clark said. 'We're from an overall safety perspective looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally.' Organizers of the 'Flags Over VSU' rally said they expected as many as 4,000 people Friday afternoon, WALB-TV reported . University administrators arranged for extra police to be on campus to provide security during the rally, Clark told The Valdosta Daily Times. Local law enforcement officials said the crowd that gathered was generally peaceful. Pro-flag: A flag supporter waves a large American flag while attending a rally on Friday in support of the flag . In support: Flag supporters on motorbikes attend a rally on Friday in support of Michelle Manhart . University administrators faced a backlash on social media after Manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning, essentially banning her from campus. Critics saw the university as siding with demonstrators who walked on the flag over a military veteran trying to save it. 'We were protecting their right to free speech and civil liberties' without taking sides, Clark said. NBC reports that some people T-shirts with the American flag and the words 'Try walking on this flag' written on the back and others carried signs. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition . NBC spoke with Kim Thompson who drove 30 miles to join in the rally. 'I think it's going to be amazing. I think it's actually going to be part of history,' she said. Thompson, the wife of a sailor, said that after September 11 she became more patriotic than ever and felt that she needed to speak up after watching the flag get trampled. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators last week. Video footage of the event, last Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don’t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn’t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I’m not fighting against them. I’m fighting against the way they are going about it.' Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above . Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread . According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service . She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition -  and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'", "summary": "Hundreds protested an Air Force vet and former Playboy model's arrest when she tried to stop people from trampling on a flag .\nValdosta State University closed after police warned there would be thousands of protesters and as they searched for student Eric Sheppard .\nPolice said they traced a gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest .\nMichelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed at Valdosta State University, Georgia .\nFormer USAF training sergeant took flag from campus protesters on Friday .\nPolice arrested her for not giving it back because of how it was treated .\nManhart posed for raunchy military-themed Playboy spread in 2007 .\nWas demoted from her sergeant rank, and later left the military ."}
{"document": "Asia Siddiqui not only saw herself as a soldier for Allah, but a poet as well. The 31-year-old woman who was arrested Thursday in New York for allegedly hatching a terrorist plot with her former roommate, 28-year-old Noelle Velentzas, was also friends with the one-time editor of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire. Samir Khan, an American citizen, was killed in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen. But before that he published several articles in Inspire, including a DIY bomb-making guide which the Boston bombers allegedly used to make their twin pressure-cooker explosives. Kahn was apparently so chummy with Siddiqui that he published one of her poems  in the precursor to Inspire, a publication called Jihad Recollections. Scroll down for full poem . A soldier and a poet: Asia Siddiqui (right), one of the two woman arrested in Queens, NY on Thursday for plotting a terrorist attack had previously published a poem in an Al Qaeda magazine, it was revealed.  Siddiqui and her accused co-conspirator Noelle Velentzas (left) pictured in a court sketch from Thursday . Extremist friends: Siddiqui befriended Samir Khan (left) in 2006, three years before he left the U.S. for Yemen and started Al Qaeda magazine Inspire (right). Khan published Siddiqui's poem in a publication which was the precursor for Inspire. Khan was killed in a 2011 drone strike . The poem, titled 'Take Me to the Lands Where the Eyes are Cooled' details Siddiqui's aspiration to  'drop bombs' and 'taste the Truth through fists and slit throats'. The informant says Siddiqui boasted about the poem in a August 2014 conversation, and said she had it published under the name 'Murdiyyah'. That same name was connected to a Facebook account associated with Siddiqui's computer IP address. According to the lengthy criminal complaint against Siddiqui and Velentzas,  Siddiqui met Khan sometime in 2006, while he was still living in the U.S. and they continued to communicate after he moved to Yemen in 2009. Siddiqui and Velentzas have been accused of plotting to carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City, and referred to themselves as 'real bad b****es' in conversations with a federal informant. The informant says the two were considering targeting a military base or police funeral with a homemade bomb - but that there was no specific terrorist plot at the time of their arrest Thursday. Siddiqui's friend Kahn was born to Pakistani parents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 25, 1989, but spent most of his life growing up in Queens - the same NYC borough where Siddiqui and Velentzas lived. Captured: Above, the home in Queens where Asia Siddiqui was arrested for allegedly plotting a bomb attack on the United States. She met fellow Queens native Samir Khan in 2006, and later had him publish one of her poems in an Al Qaeda magazine he was editing at the time from Yemen . DIY: Khan went on to found Inspire, an Al Qaeda magazine. One of the articles he wrote for the magazine a a bomb-making how-to guide apparently used by Boston bombers Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) Other than refusing to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and blaming 9/11 on America, Khan appeared to be a well-adjusted young man when he attended  W Tresper Clarke High School. At the school, Khan wrote for the student newspaper, and participated in cheerleading and the glee club. However, at some point while still living in the U.S., Kahn started writing about Jihad from his parent's basement with a blog called 'InshallahShaheed,' or 'Martyr, God willing'. In 2004, his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where he attended Central Piedmont Community College. Five years later, Khan cut ties with his family and moved to Yemen. Khan was killed in a September 30, 2011 drone strike in Yemen - the same one that claimed the life of infamous American-born Islamic militant Anwar al-Awlaki.

Scroll down for video . The old adage may claim that a liar can not look you in the eye, but in truth liars often stare . Darren Stanton, who has become the UK's top human leading human lie detector and body expert, appeared on This Morning . He managed to suss out when both Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden were were fibbing and also appeared in a video clip catching out a cheating husband for lying about an affair. He asked Amanda Holden to conceal a ball and then try and trick him about which hand it was in, but Darren managed to spot her fib straight away. 'I noticed a slight flick on that side of the mouth – a micro expression,' he said, much to the presenters amazement. Philip Schofield was also caught fibbing, which Darren said he detected by a raised eyebrow. The full-time human lie detector, who recently sat in on the phone hacking trial, then shared his secrets on the This Morning website. How do you tell if someone is telling porkies? 'People might clutch a clipboard, file or coffee cup to their chest, creating a subconscious barrier if they're lying,' he says. 'Or hold it in two hands. Darren knew presenter Amanda Holden was fibbing due to a slight flick on one side of the mouth, much to the presenters amazement. 'Statistically it's a myth that a liar can't look you in the eye. Three to five seconds of eye contact is normal. Any longer and they are either in love with you or fibbing. He also said that brief answers and hesitation are also signs of lying. 'Liars don't like being asked for details. If they're not prepared, they'll either mirror your language or stutter for an answer,' he explains. 'The greater the consequences, the more signals a liar gives off,' adds, giving the example that a person who has committed a serious fraud would give more signals than someone who has stolen a cream cake. But according to the lie-sniffing expert people often have an accurate gut instinct about whether those close to them are telling the truth or not. 'The difference is that the techniques I've learned accelerate this process so I can have the same level of rapport and insight with another in seconds,' he explains. But one of the easiest ways to spot a liar is spotting a twitch. Liars often twitch when they are being untruthful,' he says. 'Sometimes it can be a particularly long blink, or it could be a tiny muscle in the cheek or neck. Men in particular have an area at the bottom of their nose that twitches when they are fibbing.'

Spending on consultants has doubled to £1.4billion over the past four years and now makes up more than ten per cent of all foreign aid spending, an investigation revealed. Hundreds of ‘team leaders’ working on aid projects earn at least £120,000 a year once the costs of their expenses, security and accommodation are taken into account, an investigation found. Daily rates of between £800 and £1000 are commonplace, the Times newspaper claimed. The revelations will return attention to Britain’s growing aid budget, which now accounts for some £12 billion of public spending a year. The Coalition government committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid – and even passed legislation to enshrine the target into law. That target means that aid spending will increase every year if the economy grows, even if other areas of government spending face swingeing cuts. David Cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending while slashing funding for the police, defence and justice. The details of consultant spending sparked outrage among backbench Tories who have opposed the aid target. Philip Davies, who is Tory parliamentary candidate for Shipley said: ‘When people think of overseas aid they think of people who have aid their homes damaged by an earthquake, a hurricane or a tsunami. They don’t expect to be lining the pockets of consultant fat cats. ‘This is what happens when you are judged only by how much you are spending. How you actually spend the money becomes immaterial. It leads to grotesque waste and overspending.’ The Department for International Development said it uses private sector companies as well as charities to deliver aid projects if they were the best placed to do the job. But officials insisted that spending on external consultants giving advice to the department had fallen. A spokesman said: ‘DfID has slashed spending on external consultancy and advisory services by 98.9 per cent since 2009, down to just £200,000 last year, but we rightly continue to use the private sector where it delivers aid projects on the ground that are effective and the best value for money.’ Afghan widows queueing up and waiting to receive aid in Kabul, Afghanistan . The Times quoted anonymous ‘insiders’ claiming that private firms were making huge profits of 50 per cent on aid projects. A report in January by the National Audit Office found civil servants at the department went on a £1billion spending spree over eight weeks to hit the government target. Money was spent at the end of last year on humanitarian programmes but MPs questioned whether the rate of spending meant it achieved value for money. The coalition aid commitment – meant Dfid was required to spent some £11.46 billion in 2013.. But in June that year officials realised they would have to spend another £2.7billion in November and December to hit the target. Months later that target was revised up again by another £1billion over those two months, taking the total to £3.7billion. The NAO report said the burst of spending that raised concerns the money was not used wisely. It said: “Given the limited time available the department could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013. It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending.”", "summary": "Spending on consultants doubled to £1.4billion over the past four years .\nDaily rates of between £800 and £1,000 are reportedly commonplace .\nDavid Cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending ."}

The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James'. The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. A touching tribute: James told Lauren not to have 'too much fun up there without all your family and friends' 'Tell my Grandma I said hello': He added that he had spoken 'plenty of times' about Lauren to his grandmother . #RIPLaurenHill: The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James' (pictured). The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times . Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance . Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away . In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati . Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.

{"document": "John Hinckley Jr. has found love. Hinckley, who still spends half of his days institutionalized after being found not guilty by reason of insanity for shooting President Ronald Reagan back in 1981, is said to have met the woman at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting. This was revealed by his brother Scott during a hearing to determine if Hinckley should be able to permanently live outside St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and instead with his mother, where he has resided 17 days out of the month since December 2013. Scroll down for video . John Hinckley Jr. (above) has been dating a woman he met at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting . This was revealed by his brother Scott (above) during a hearing to determine if he should be released from the institution he has been at since shooting President Reagan . Hinckley currently splits his time between St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia (above) Scott went on to describe his brother and his new girlfriend as 'somewhat compatible,' though he admitted he had not met the woman. Hinckley's mother Joan has been introduced to her son's girlfriend reports NBC News. Hinckley shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Testimony is expected to wrap up next week to determine if he can move in permanently with his mother, but it could be months before US District Judge Paul Friedman renders a decision. Prosecutor Colleen Kennedy has argued that the provisions suggested for expanded release were inadequate for a would-be presidential assassin. Hinckley also has written to killers Ted Bundy and Charles Manson, and in January he deceived doctors about where he was going when he was away from St. Elizabeths, she said. 'Now is not the time to loosen the reins of the hospital,' she said. Hinckley's mother Joan (above) has been introduced to her son's girlfriend . Hinckley (left) shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster in 1981 (right) Initial testimony centered on whether Hinckley's family could bear the financial cost of supporting him and his care. Prosecutors put the cost at $5,000 to $10,000 a month, and said the family would run out of money in one or two years. But his siblings, who both live in Dallas, said the value of their mother's retirement fund and home totaled about $500,000, and vowed to support him financially. During a 2011 hearing, prosecutors argued Hinckley repeatedly engaged in deception when away from the hospital. Secret Service agents saw him browsing books on Reagan and on other presidential assassins in 2011 instead of going to a movie, as he had told doctors he would. Brady died in August at age 73, and a coroner determined the death was attributable to the shooting.

The Chancellor said Labour had ‘form’ on jacking up income tax and National Insurance and insisted Ed Balls and Ed Miliband would do the same if given the chance after May 7. ‘Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have done it all before – and they would do it all over again,’ he said. Scroll down for video . Chancellor  George Osborne (left) has warned that taxes will rise under Labour and said the party had 'form' on rising taxes. He said: ‘Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right) have done it all before – and they would do it all again' Today, as he begins a tour of all four nations of the UK, David Cameron will say there is just one month to save Britain from the ‘disaster’ of a Miliband government. Yesterday the Prime Minister stepped up his attack on tax by insisting Labour was planning to drag nearly one million more people into the 40p tax rate. And in a pointed attack on his coalition partners, he dismissed the Lib Dems as being among the ‘minor parties’ making ‘more and more strange claims’. Mr Cameron said voters would pay a ‘heavy price’ for a Labour government which would be ‘looking in your payslip’ for tax. He also condemned Labour’s plans to abolish the married couples tax allowance, which came into effect yesterday. Speaking in Leeds, Ed Balls said the tax break – worth £200 a year to couples who have tied the knot – was ‘perverse’. Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls also repeated his claim – denied outright by the Tories – that they would raise VAT. He said a Tory government would mean ‘millions paying more while millionaires pay less’ as he accused the party of planning to cut the top rate of income tax for those earning over £150,000. Meanwhile a major spat erupted between the Tories and Lib Dems, as Danny Alexander was accused of inventing an extraordinary claim about a senior Tory. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury claimed that during negotiations for the 2012 Budget, a Tory minister told him: ‘You take care of the workers and we’ll take care of the bosses’. Today, as he begins a tour of all four nations of the UK, David Cameron (left) will say there is just one month to save Britain from the ‘disaster’ of a Miliband (right) government, which would see voters 'pay a heavy price' He refused to say who it was. Mr Alexander made the comments, in the Independent newspaper, as his party attempted to claw back credit for cutting the personal rate of income tax from the Tories. But Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC’s World at One the claim was ‘complete rubbish’. He added: ‘The reason why he wouldn’t actually tell you who he thinks said it is he knows that no one said it.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Mr Osborne of being a ‘very dangerous man’ because of his cuts plans. Mr Cameron dismissed the remarks, saying: ‘You are going to hear minor parties just making more and more strange claims to say “look at me, look at what I’m saying”.’ Mr Osborne released figures, by the independent House of Commons Library, showing the extent of tax and National Insurance rises under Labour from 1997 to 2010. Combined taxes on income went up by an average of £1,895 across all households, he said. They rose among every income group, with those earning £15,500 hit the hardest. He repeated his claim Labour is planning a £3,000 tax bombshell, saying: ‘We’re publishing figures that show Labour’s got form on tax.’ Mr Cameron, who will visit England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in a single day today, will say there is ‘one month to save our economy from the disaster of an Ed Miliband government’.", "summary": "George Osborne has warned that taxes will rise under Labour Government .\nChancellor claimed Labour has 'done it before and will do it all over again'\nTaxes on earnings rose nearly £1,900 under 13 years of Labour, stats show ."}
{"document": "An upcoming documentary describes Yelp as the internet's equivalent to the mafia, and the publicly-traded company is doing everything in its power to discredit the film before it is released. Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video . A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he’s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn’t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production. The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. Prost Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.", "summary": "Billion Dollar Bully, an upcoming documentary, focuses on the review site's impact on small businesses .\nFilmmaker Kaylie Milliken spoke to several business owners who believe their Yelp ratings went down after they declined to advertise on the site .\nThe company has denied the allegations, citing court rulings, an FTC investigation and a Harvard study as validation of their business practices ."}

It has since emerged that Mr Lubitz had carefully planned the attack using the online pseudonym ‘Skydevil’, according to the German newspaper Bild. As the plane plummeted towards ground, Mr Sondheimer, 36, a father-of-two, tried in vain to save the lives of the 144 passengers and five crew members on board. Moments before, he had left the cockpit in the hands of his co-pilot in order to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked and co-pilot Lubitz, 27, ignored desperate pleas from his colleague to let him back in.

During a memorial on March 29, his grandmother Marianne Sondheimer said her grandson’s lifelong dream was to become a pilot. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people.’ During the service, Captain Sondheimer was described as a man who ‘radiated happiness’.

{"document": "David Cameron this morning launched a furious attack on Labour MPs 'bleating' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year. The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: ‘True compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance.’ He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning £87 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not ‘playing the system’ but were ‘victims of it’. He said they were ‘victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers’. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net – not a web from which no-one could escape. ‘So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. ‘It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don’t you dare lecture us on poverty. ‘And know this – the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.’ Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. ‘For many second earners, work didn’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. ‘In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £5,000 to working families. ‘That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017.’ Mr Cameron also argued ‘that true compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance’. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £350 million a year.", "summary": "Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare .\nHe accused Ed Miliband of having 'some brass neck' by attacking Tories .\nMr Cameron said he wanted to 'make hard work pay' unlike Labour .\nHe said that work rather than benefits is the best way to avoid poverty .\nThe Prime Minister announced 600,000 new childcare places today ."}

Phylise Davis-Bowens, who attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, for their 'transformative leadership' program at the age of 37, launched a lawsuit after she alleged she was not allowed to try out for the 14 Karat Gold dancers. Mrs Davis-Bowens, a substitute public school teacher in Miami who married last Valentine's Day, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that she was discriminated against because of her weight and missed out on part of the academic experience. Phylise Davis-Bowens, 42, who attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is suing her former college because she was not allowed to try out for the 14 Karat Gold dancers in 2009 . The 14 Karat Gold dancers are regular performers at sporting events related to the Florida university . The student, who had been dancing since the age of 16, had wanted to join the dance troupe to use her performance work as part of her thesis in 2009. Band director Donovan Wells told her she could try out for the team if she lost 20lb, she said. Mrs Davis-Bowens went on to lose 16lb in one month in order to try out but was still denied an audition for the dance troupe. After around a year, she had lost a total of 60lb. She told Daily Mail Online: 'I wanted to join because of my talent but the coach said I didn't have the body type. But to me, I have two arms and two legs which is what I needed.' The weight discrimination is of particular importance to Mrs Davis-Bowens because she lost her sister at the age of 37 to a gastric bypass because she was obese and felt under pressure to quickly lose weight. The 42-year-old said she also has ongoing health issues from losing weight quickly. According to their Facebook page, the 14 Karat Gold dancers are made up of college students who perform alongside the Marching Wildcats during college sporting events. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Monday, a university spokeswoman said: 'Bethune-Cookman University was made aware today that a complaint was filed. 'We are currently investigating this matter. B-CU is an equal opportunity institution and encourage all students to be actively involved in our campus extracurricular offerings.' Ms Davis-Bowens' lawyer, David Glasser, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that his client had brought the lawsuit to make a point about discrimination and was seeking unspecified damages in district court which can award more than $15,000. The 42-year-old graduated from the college in 2011 and went on to teach in the Miami-Dade public school district. She also claimed that the school did not allow her to attend the graduation ceremony and sent her diploma in the mail.

{"document": "Father-of-two: Paul Doyle, 56, has been jailed after being unmasked as the head of drugs ring . A gangster who lived a life of luxury in a mansion near Premier League footballers has been jailed for 16 years after being unmasked as the head of a drugs ring. Father-of-two Paul Doyle, 56, moved his family into an £820,000 home in Altrincham, Cheshire, despite having never worked and living life ‘on tick’ and incapacity handouts. Doyle - described as a ‘well-known and colourful character’ in his native Salford - put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive. But his family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood in Altrincham where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children who complained of being robbed and beaten up. Police kept watch on the family’s home where Doyle chopped down the huge front hedge so he could check for unwanted visitors outside. He was eventually arrested during a raid on his five-bedroom house after a major investigation into the supply of various drugs in the North of England, which culminated in the seizure of £15million of cocaine and a haul of heroin. The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford. Doyle admitted supplying class A and B drugs, between 2012 and 2014, plus money laundering and benefit fraud offences at Manchester Crown Court. He now faces a proceeds of crime hearing. Going in: Police are seen raiding Doyle's £820,000 five-bedroom home in Altrincham, Cheshire, in July 2014 . Luxurious life: Doyle put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage on the property (above) by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive . The court heard Doyle had bought the house as his ‘dream family home’ in 2004 after being freed from a seven-year jail term for cocaine and cannabis dealing plus assault. He was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work. But he fraudulently claimed Mrs Doyle earned £197,000 a year as a ‘project executive’ for a lettings firm and she was given a mortgage of £616,000. Monthly mortgage repayments were about £3,000 but the accounts were consistently in arrears. And in June 2006 Doyle took out loans totalling £83,000 with finance companies by making similar false representations about Mrs Doyle’s income - and even acquired a new BMW vehicle. Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012. On average monthly deposits of £5,778 were made totalling around £77,000 per year. Police began secretly filming Doyle and started to track his car. It emerged he helped finance a cocaine deal in which drugs were brought into the country by couriers who travelled to the UK from France on fishing boats. Entering: The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford . Going in: Doyle's family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children . Up to 4.2lbs (1.9kg) of heroin and 170lbs (77kg) of cocaine landed in the UK - but police began arresting Doyle’s accomplices, and he got directly involved in deals himself. He organised a collection of 2.2lbs (1kg) of heroin in Wigan, and then started running a wholesale supply line in cannabis, involving up to 88lbs (40kg), and amphethamines, amounting to around  44lbs (20kg), to crime families in Barrow-in-Furness and Carlisle in Cumbria. He was eventually caught in May last year with 6.6lbs (3kg) of amphetamines in Salford. Whilst in jail on remand police decoded conversations in which Doyle chatted about drugs - one in which he talked about how a friend ‘wanted his hoover back’ - linking him to a Cumbrian heroin dealer who hid just an ounce of the drug inside his Henry vacuum cleaner. Suspicion: Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012 . Home: Doyle was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work . Other recorded conversations heard Doyle use the codeword ‘downstairs’ for heroin, which police were able to work out because of the timing and context of the conversations. Altrincham, a market town near Manchester Airport, is the location of four of the ten most expensive streets in the North West. The top-priced road has an average property value of £2.5million. Manchester City stars James Milner and Joe Hart live in the Altrincham area, in homes worth £3.3million and £2.9million respectively, and Ireland assistant boss Roy Keane is said to have a house there. The local residents also include ex-England international Emily Heskey, who now plays for Bolton Wanderers in the Championship and lives in a £3million six-bedroom house with his wife Chantelle. The Hale area of Altrincham was reported to be home to at least 33 Premier League footballers as of 2010 - including Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United players. Ian McMeekin, defending, said the case was the ‘decline and fall of a drug dealer’. He said Doyle once had a building supply business and when buildings were demolished he would broker on the stolen brick. He added: ‘He is a well known local, born and raised in Salford. He is well known as a colourful character.’ He added that he also undertook protection work in West Africa and China where he was working legitimately but while not paying income tax. He said he was also provided with income from dog breeding. Mr McMeekin said: ‘He didn’t involve his wife through pressure or influence. He operated alone and in ignorance. His wife’s salary was ridiculously high, ought to make anyone question the legitimacy of the application. ‘The defendant has nothing left apart from his family - the house has gone. His ruin is complete and he must accept the whole responsibility for it.’ Sentencing, Judge Richard Mansell QC told Doyle he had ‘barefaced gall’ to claim benefits and added: ‘I’m quite satisfied that you played a lead role in all of your offences. ‘You had close links to the original sources of the drugs and you directed and organised the sale of drugs on a commercial scale. You plainly did make a lot of money from these enterprises - where it has gone is another matter.’ He described Doyle as ‘the head of an organised criminal gang’, who continued to orchestrate the business from behind bars because he had ‘loyal servants working on the outside’.", "summary": "Father-of-two Paul Doyle moved family into £820,000 home in Altrincham .\nHe bought it after seven-year jail term for cocaine and cannabis dealing .\nAdmitted supplying  drugs,  money laundering and benefit fraud offences .\nTeenage son rode quad bikes and got Asbo for terrorising local children ."}

{"document": "Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara to turn around his troubled season at Tannadice. McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results allied to the revelation that he receives a cut of transfer fees for United players sales. Since selling prize assets Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic for £2million on transfer deadline day, United have won just once, in a Scottish Cup tie at Stranraer. Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara . McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results . After 10 games without a win, the heat was turned up on McNamara on Wednesday night when United lost 3-1 at Dens Park – their first derby defeat to Dundee since November 2004. However, as McNamara comes under increasing pressure from United fans, some of whom believe his position is untenable, Armstrong yesterday backed his old boss to ride out the most testing period of his managerial career. ‘Jackie McNamara is a good guy. He was always really nice to me when I was at United - and he is capable of turning it around,’ said the 23-year-old. Celtic unveil former Dundee Utd teammates Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven following their exit . ‘Yes, United are having woes just now. They are on a bad run of form, and the injuries aren’t really helping either. But these things happen in football. I am sure Jackie McNamara and United will turn it around – it’s just a matter of time.’ Asked yesterday if this spell was the toughest test so far of his managerial career, McNamara said: ‘Not really. We went through a spell last year but it’s things I’ll learn from. I am learning so it’s been good in that sense. ‘I’ve learned different things, reasons for things and different scenarios recently. I think that will stand me in good stead.’ Mackay-Steven (right) celebrates his goal with former Dundee United teammate John Rankin . Ex-United defender Mark Wilson, who also left Tannadice in January, insists the root of the current crisis at United has been their losing streak - not the manager’s controversial bonus scheme. United face Hamilton today, who have not won in 12 matches, and Wilson believes ‘bruised figure’ McNamara can win back the fans if he can restore his team to winning ways. ‘The bonus row doesn’t sit well with the fans,’ conceded Wilson. ‘But that’s purely because the team is losing. If the team was winning it would all be brushed under the carpet. ‘Does the manager look a bruised figure right now? Yes, but you can see why! He’ s built a successful attacking team and his players are getting ripped away. Former Dundee United ace Armstrong celebrates with Mackay-Steven after scoring for Celtic . 'You don’t know whether the players had clauses, or whether it’s been a decision made at the top of the club, but if you took Armstrong and Mackay Steven out of any team it would leave a massive hole. 'Take away Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld, who were sold last summer, that’s four mainstays of last year’s team now gone. ‘Those are big shoes to fill, and I’m sure the likes of Aidan Connolly and Blair Spitall, if given time, will do that. Jackie has shown he can go out and buy and rear genuine stars. I believe there is still enough quality there for United to grind out results and start climbing up the league.’", "summary": "Stuart Armstrong has backed Jackie McNamara to come good again .\nMcNamara faced a furious fan backlash recently amid woeful results .\nClub have won once since Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven left .\nWas also revealed that McNamara receives cut of transfer fees ."}
{"document": "The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, says  he may never again see out of one eye. 'I am sightless in my right eye,' he told Fusion and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. Reid said he is 'over' the fear that he may not regain vision in that eye following a New Year's Day exercise accident that left him battered and bruised because 'I can’t see out of my eye, and that’s the way it’s going to be until something comes along that’ll change it.' 'Right now, I’ve had 11 hours of surgery. They’ve tried. I can’t see out of my right eye. And that’s okay, I can live with that,' he said, according to Fusion. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is pictured here on Monday in his home state of Nevada. Reid said in an interview this week that he might not ever be able to see out of his right eye again following a January accident . The lawmaker's tale of how he came to sustain broken bones in his face while working out in his Nevada home with a plastic exercise band is one that has been questioned, mostly by conservatives, especially after Reid announced last month that he would retire. A March 31 Breitbart News story regaled the layout of Reid's Searchlight home and the master bathroom, where Reid says the accident occurred. Rumors have persisted since the January 1 accident that the Nevada mob may have been involved, even though there's no evidence to suggest the Reid was the victim of an organized attack. Last week the conservative Powerline blog suggested that Reid may have been beat up by his brother, Larry. Recounting a story brought forward by a man who says he attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting with Larry, it suggested, based on the account, that Larry and Harry may have tussled on the day in question. Referring indirectly to the rumors, Ramos told Reid, 'It looked like somebody had hit you.' Reid told the news anchor in turn that he was 'fortunate' the band only hit him in the temple. Going into further detail about the incident than he had in the past, the 75-year-old former boxer said he was using the band because 'I was trying to maintain my firmness.' 'That was my weight training,' he said. Reid explained that he was exercising in his new home in Nevada at the time when the strip 'slipped, spun me around, about, I guess four feet.' 'I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard...' he said trailing off as Ramos interrupted him with another question. Rumors have persisted since the January 1 accident that the Nevada mob may have been involved, even though there's no evidence to suggest the Reid was the victim of an organized attack. Reid is pictured here on February 3 during a Capitol Hill news conference . The longtime lawmaker, upon announcing his retirement last month, insisted his departure from the Senate was not related to the accident. And he told Ramos in the interview that aired on Tuesday that he was leaving the legislative body in two years when his current term expires because 'I want to remembered for my first 34 years in congress, not my last six.' One of the most memorable moments from Reid's career in recent years was his 2012 charge that the GOP's nominee for president, Mitt Romney, didn't pay his taxes for a decade. Reid first made the accusation during an interview with the Huffington Post, and several days later repeated it on the Senate floor. Then the highest-ranking Senator, Reid said his evidence came from former Bain Capitol colleagues of Romney's. Reid told Ramos in the Fusion interview that the episode had been 'blown way out of proportion.' 'Mitt Romney, during the time he was running for President, refused to give us his tax returns. When I ran for the Senate in 1974 that was an issue, tax returns,' Reid said. 'This has been an issue of mine for a long time.' The Democratic leader said the onus remains on Romney to produce evidence that he did pay his taxes. Reid also refused to give up the sources of his information that Romney may not have. 'Of course he paid taxes. What he didn't do is let us see his tax returns,' Reid told Ramos, claiming he's said as much 'many many times.' 'Let him give us his tax returns. Let the American people judge that,' he stated. Reid said he has 'no repentance' for dragging Romney through the mud because 'it is an issue that was important.' Asked if he had any apologies for Romney Reid was just as direct. 'Oh none, whatsoever. Zero. None,' the retiring lawmaker said.", "summary": "'Right now, I’ve had 11 hours of surgery. They’ve tried.

{"document": "Tom Boyd believes Jason Denayer’s loan spell at Celtic has been so successful that he is now ready to challenge for a place at Manchester City next season. Such an outcome would obviously deny Ronny Deila’s stated aim of retaining the young Belgian for another year, yet Boyd also sees a clear positive. To the former Celtic captain, Denayer’s development can act as a perfect advert to encourage more emerging talents to take their next career step at Parkhead. Young defender Jason Denayer (left) has impressed on loan at Celtic this season . The 19-year-old recently won his first international cap for Belgium in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Cyprus . The 19-year-old earned a first full cap for his country when he came off the bench in their 1-0 win in Israel on Tuesday night following a red card for Vincent Kompany. Denayer will hope to join Kompany in City’s first-team squad when he returns to his parent club this summer and Boyd feels he is equipped to take that step. ‘Jason certainly looks like he could go back to Man City and make an impression,’ said Boyd. ‘For a young boy, he’s been exceptional. He looks a lot older in his play and it surprises you when you remind yourself how young he actually is. ‘The only question is whether he will get the opportunities he wants down there. I think he will, especially now that he is featuring for Belgium in a qualification game. ‘Unfortunately, Celtic can’t compete with the money on offer in England. The new television deal down there has taken things to another level again. ‘I’d love Jason to stay at Celtic for 10 years but that’s not going to happen. He’s an ambitious boy and wants to go and challenge himself to be the best he can. From some of the games I’ve seen, I think he could slot into that City defence no problem. Denayer has been tipped to partner Belgium team-mate Vincent Kompany (left) on his return to City . Denayer has formed a successful partnership with Dutchman Virgil van Dijk (left) at Parkhead . ‘However, hopefully his success will help Celtic bring more youngsters in. Previously people said you move to England to get international caps. Jason and Fraser Forster showed that’s not the case. ‘Hopefully Celtic can say, “Come here and you will progress” and use those examples to attract players.’ Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that Hearts captain Danny Wilson is one central defensive candidate under consideration by Celtic as they look a potential additions for next term. ‘Good players attract attention and Danny has been playing very well for Hearts,’ said Boyd. ‘He is certainly someone who was very promising as a young boy and is hopefully getting back to that level.’ The current partnership between Denayer and Virgil van Dijk has formed the foundation of Celtic’s bid for the Treble – a feat the club last achieved in 2001 when Boyd was skipper. Manager Ronny Deila should be able to attract rising youngsters to the Hoops, claims Tom Boyd . Celtic are considering a bid for Hearts defender Danny Wilson to shore up their defence . While some will point to the absence of a competitive Rangers from the top-flight, the ex-Scotland international is adamant a domestic clean sweep this term would be the equal of his achievement under Martin O’Neill’s management. ‘A Treble this year would stand beside the other three in Celtic’s history,’ said Boyd. ‘You have to beat what is in front of you. ‘There have only been three in Celtic’s history and that tells you how hard it is to achieve it. ‘If they do get the Treble, there should be the same adulation as when my team won it in 2001 and Jock Stein’s team did it twice. ‘It would be a fantastic achievement if Scott Brown was collecting the Scottish Cup to complete a Treble. ‘The League has been a challenge with Aberdeen doing so well, although I think the pressure will eventually tell. ‘You can’t take away what Celtic have achieved so far and sometimes the difficult part of the Treble is winning the cups. ‘Celtic have had a terrible record in the League Cup over the years and that shows how hard it is. ‘I’d like to see the talking done when they have two in the bag and are preparing for the Scottish Cup final. ‘Ronny’s approach is new. He’s spoken about the Treble from the start but it does show the level of confidence he has.’ Former captain Boyd insists a treble for Celtic this season will equal his own three-way success from 2001 . Boyd was speaking at Hampden as he launched the search for nominees to be inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. The 49-year-old has a very decent claim himself, but would be delighted if figures who operated behind the scenes were recognised. ‘Professor (Stewart) Hillis, who passed away last year, and other Scotland backroom guys who maybe aren’t as well-known would be very deserving of being in there. ‘Jimmy Steele is another one who contributed a lot with Celtic and the national team - and I think that would be a great gesture if they were inducted.’ Fans can make nominations by logging on to sfmhalloffame.co.uk. Inductees will be announced at a Hampden dinner on October 18.", "summary": "Young Belgian Jason Denayer has impressed on loan with Celtic .\nFormer Hoops captain Tom Boyd claims the defender is ready to challenge for a place at Manchester City next season .\nRonny Deila is looking at Hearts defender Danny Wilson to fill the void ."}

{"document": "When Asma Fahmi took her ill mother to a matinee screening of Les Miserables in Sydney, the last thing she expected was a violent racial attack on her and her family in broad daylight. This 34-year-old has spoken about the horrific attack by three men who pelted hard boiled eggs at them as they walked to their car in the late afternoon last Saturday. 'They were basically throwing missiles at us,' Asma told Daily Mail Australia. Asma Fahmi was walking to her car with her family when they were attacked by three men from a balcony . The 34-year-old was with her sister and ill mother when they had hard boiled eggs pelted at their heads . Her mother suffers from Bells Palsy, among other health ailments and finds it difficult to leave the house due to her condition. 'She is also a full time carer for my grandma who has been in hospital for the past month,' Asma said. 'She's always looking after everyone else and is extremely selfless.' Due to this, Asma and her sister believed that a day out at the theatre was exactly what their mother needed. After a seeing a matinee screening of Les Miserables in Haymarket and having a late Thai lunch, Asma and her family were walking to their car on the corner of Castlereagh and Goulburn street in the CBD when they heard yelling from an apartment overhead. 'There were three men and they were saying, 'You f***ing Pakis, you f***ing Pakis' over and over,' Asma said. She noticed that the men all had British accents and thought they must be British backpackers as the term 'Paki' tends to be used as an insult in the United Kingdom. This was the second time that Asma has been attacked in Sydney in four years . Asma believes that many  victims of racial attack have no faith in the legal system and therefore many incidents go unreported . 'They were so ignorant they couldn't even get their racism correct,' Asma said. 'My sister and I started to cheekily dance to their chanting to show that it doesn't really bother us.' It wasn't until hard boiled eggs began to rain down on their heads that she became seriously concerned. Asma's immediate worry was for her sister's brand new car, however that quickly changed when an egg flew centimetres from her head and she had to dive behind another car. 'They threw something else -it could have been a glass bottle - and it smashed into the car next to us and knocked off the side mirror,' she said. 'We were certain these people were insane.' Asma attempted to take a photo of the men but became too fearful of her safety and jumped in the car. 'This is downtown Sydney in broad daylight and it feels like a war zone,' she said. Asma's mother cried in the car on their way home as she believed she had brought bad luck by leaving the house. This is not the first racially based attack that Asma has experienced in Sydney. In 2012 on her way to work, a man put his leg between hers and forced her to the ground, spitting abuse at her while she lay on the pavement. Asma is pictured here with refugees in Jordan, she also volunteers at the Islamophobia Register Australia . Asma came to Australia  when she was just four-years-old from Syria, and has lived here for most of her life . 'He spat his words out with so much anger and called me a 'f***king terrorist,' she said. 'The worst part was that there were so many witnesses who did nothing and didn't even ask me if I was ok.' Asma walked into the state government building where she worked after the attack, with some of the witnesses even getting into the elevator with her while remaining silent. She came to Australia from Syria with her family when she was just four years old and has resided in Sydney for most of her life. She now volunteers at the Islamophobia Register Australia typing up incident reports and has found that a lot of the victims of racial abuse are women. She said that many of the victims have no faith in the legal system. 'People don't really know what to do an what the next step is,' she said. Although Asma had memorised the apartment the men were in and their general appearance, she has not yet heard back from the police.

{"document": "Tesla founder Elon Musk has unveiled a 'revolutionary' $3,000 (£1,980) battery which he claims can run an entire home for eight hours. Musk introduced the Powerwall device at a press conference in California last night and said the technology could 'change the world'. The device, which could be in homes by the end of summer, will be able to store electricity at night when it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Tesla has unveiled a $3,000 (£1,980) home battery that can power an entire house for eight hours. Powerwall is three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed on an outside or inside wall. The left images shows the 10kWh version while on the right is the 7kWh device . The technology powers up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch the battery on during the day to use the home during the day. Powerwall can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency, or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. The  average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. It would then discharge this cheap electricity during the day in quantities large enough to be useful to homes and businesses. The  Powerwall is around three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed either on an outside or inside wall of a home. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. Department of Energy figures state that the average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. According to that figure, a single, fully-charged Powerwall device would be able to meet a quarter of a home's energy needs on any given day. However, it would likely last far less time than eight hours during the mornings and evenings, when homes use the vast majority of their electricity. Musk said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy. The system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home, rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced, then buy it again during peak times. It could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper, stored energy during peak periods. According to tech site Mashable, Musk told attendees at the event: 'Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy. Pictured is a utility-scale version of Powerwall that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power . The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage . Tesla also unveiled the 'Powerpack', which is the big brother of the Powerwall. It describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that can work for businesses, in industrial applications, and public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh. 'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. 'It sounds crazy, but we want to change the entire energy infrastructure of the world to zero carbon.' As well as the daily-use model, Tesla will also launch a 10 kilowatt-hour backup battery, designed to tide homes over during power blackouts, such as those caused by storms. Marketing material for the device, published late Thursday on Tesla's website, says: 'Powerwall is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening. 'It also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup electricity supply. 'Automated, compact and simple to install, Powerwall offers independence from the utility grid and the security of an emergency backup.' Musk said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices, which he touted as a vast improvement over currently-available models. In the past he has said such early batteries 'suck'. He later added that the entire showcase had been powered by a huge array of Powerwall batteries. Pictured is the 'powerpack'.

It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh.  'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. The latest announcement builds on previous Tesla products, principally its range of cars. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. These batteries 3ft tall (0.9 metres), and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Tesla would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. Powerwall charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening . 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. Deutsche Bank estimates sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at a large factory the company is building in Nevada. Stationary storage systems could be part of a fossil-fuel free lifestyle in which an individual has solar panels on the roof, generating electricity that can power home appliances and recharge batteries in a Tesla Model S sedan parked in the garage. Government subsidies and a dramatic drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are drawing more companies into the home electricity storage business. Tesla has so far received $1.1 million from California's Self-Generation Incentive Program. Tesla has received or is poised to receive state funding for about 600 storage projects in California, according to data from the state. Though valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA. In Tesla's view, such storage systems could become part of a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle in which people can have solar panels on their roof generating electricity to power their home and recharge their electric car batteries .", "summary": "Musk unveiled Powerwall device at press conference in California .\nDaily use version will be able to store 7 kilowatt-hours of electricity .\nIt will let users store renewable energy, or pay lower, off-peak rates .\nAlso revealed a larger model which is a 'infinitely scalable system'"}

{"document": "The New Zealand family of fourteen who last month walked out of a remote Christian commune that shuns the outside world are adjusting well to life in the wider community, a relative said, with the father accepting a farm job and the family moving into a home with modern appliances. James and Hope Ben Canaan last month declared they were living in a 'false system' and left the Gloriavale Christian Community, located at Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's West Coast, with their twelve children and few worldly possessions. Founded by the Australian-born evangelical preacher Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - Gloriavale is home to around 500 residents, sometimes known as Cooperites, who wear a plain, blue uniform and reject birth control. Scroll down for video . Free: The Ben Canaan family (picture supplied) have left behind Gloriavale for the outside world. Many family are pictured here in traditional Gloriavale uniforms, although they are now allowed to wear 'modest' clothing . Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament and reject the outside world . The Ben Canaans fled some 300km south to the town of Timaru, where supporters from the Marchwiel Reformed Baptist Church community have helped them adapt to a world where Christmas and birthdays are celebrated and money is used to purchase goods and services. '(They're doing) really, really good,' said Mr Ben Canaan's aunt, Miracle, who herself fled the picturesque commune with her husband and ten children around six years ago. 'They are adapting very well. They've got a job and everything. They've had a lot of support.'

The Ben Canaans' close supporters have closed ranks around the family, who last month thanked the community for their support and requested privacy in order to 'settle into our new lives' in Timaru. Sources familiar with Gloriavale, such as Miracle - one of Neville Cooper's ten children - discussed the challenges of adjusting to life outside the commune in general terms to Daily Mail Australia. 'There's just a complete struggle in the outside world,' she said, adding that she had 'nothing' when she left but 'managed to get away' from the community 'without too much drama'. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before. 'You know nothing of just normal, everyday stuff - like renting a home, insurance, any of those types of things. 'Often people don't have their birth certificates or bank accounts. They don't even know how to spend money, how to buy things. 'There's birthday parties, Christmas - none of that was practised in the community... It's huge, adapting (to all of that).' The Ben Canaans will now be able to readily access personal technology, like mobile phones and have a television which they can watch without restrictions. Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - is the Australian evangelist who founded the Gloriavale commune after clashing with church leaders in New Zealand and Australia. In 1995, he spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges . Former Gloriavale residents tend to find it difficult to adapt from the outside world, a former resident told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before' The Ben Canaans no longer have to wear their Gloriavale 'uniform'. Instead, Miracle said they will now wear 'modest clothes'. The women in the family will also have to adjust to a world where make-up is worn regularly. Author Fleur Beale, who wrote the book Sins of The Father about the 1989 escape of Neville Cooper's son, Phil, and his family from the commune, said the biggest challenge the Ben Canaans would have would be financial, particularly given their 12 children. 'You can imagine what it's like trying to find a place to live with a family like that,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Gloriavale residents are often dubbed 'Cooperites'. Pictured is a Gloriavale wedding . The happy couple kiss as they are led from their wedding ceremony . 'You haven't been used to handling money or buying in a shop. And what do you wear?' The details of the Ben Canaans' departure from Gloriavale remain unclear. Miracle said the community was not surrounded with large walls, but: 'There are different types of walls... 'Psychological walls as well as physical barriers, but no access to telephones and long driveways to be able to leave.' A spokesman for the commune, Fervant Steadfast, told the New Zealand Herald last month the family had been permitted to depart. 'If they want to go and live in Timaru, well, that's their choice and that's what they need to do. 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.' Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms. The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels.", "summary": "A New Zealand family of fourteen walked out of remote Christian sect .\nResidents of Gloriavale isolate themselves from the outside world .\nWith a population around 500, they do not use birth control .\nAll residents are required to wear blue uniforms .\nThey have advanced farming tech but rarely watch TV or listen to radio .\nThe 'Ben Canaan' family, as they are known, now live in Timaru .\nThey have been supported by local church who have rallied around them .\nThe family have moved into a home and the father has a job as a farmer ."}
{"document": "More than 10,000 dogs a year are poisoned after eating everyday items such as paracetamol and chocolate, a pet charity has warned. The Kennel Club says seemingly harmless foods such as hot cross buns and onions can be killers – and is urging owners to be alert to the threat. Around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the charity and the Veterinary Poisons Information Service. Of those, 470 dogs died. Sick: Around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014 . Unlike Crufts prizewinner Jagger the Irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well-meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate – which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life-threatening anaemia. Nick Sutton, a Kennel Club poisons expert, said: ‘There are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products – particularly foods eaten by humans – are fine for a dog to eat. ‘Many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much-loved pets.’ The popularity of e-cigarettes has seen them feature more prominently among poisoning cases, with 64 dogs taken to the vet in 2014 after chewing the nicotine-rich refills – an increase of 300 per cent. However, many more cases are suspected to have occurred, because not all poisonings are reported. Chewing gum was another major cause of poisoning. Just one pack of gum can prove deadly, causing dangerous drops in blood sugar and liver failure. If you fear your dog has been poisoned, the Kennel Club urges owners to contact their vet immediately, even if their dog appears well, as it can take several days before symptoms appear. Mr Sutton said: ‘Dogs are very intelligent, very curious and have a great sense of smell. ‘But we have to be careful about feeding them things that aren’t intended for them.’", "summary": "About 56,000 dogs treated by vets for poisoning between 2010 and 2014 .\nMost had simply found a piece of food lying around  or been fed a treat .\nPainkillers  the most common cause, followed by rat and mouse bait .\nKennel Club poisons expert warns even 'harmless' foods can be dangerous ."}

Joseph Oberhansley, from Jeffersonville, Indiana, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse in the death of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Harbin Blanton last September. On Tuesday, Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull asked for rape to be added to those charges and a judge will consider the request on May 4, the Courier-Journal of Louisville reported. The motion to change the charges comes after lab results for the victim's body were returned. 'Cannibal killer': Joseph Oberhansley, who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend before eating some of her organs last year, could now face a rape charge. Prosecutors say they will recommend the death penalty . Murdered: Tammy Jo Blanton, right, had called police asking for help just hours before she was found dead . Last year, prosecutors said they intended to seek the death penalty in the case. Juries in Indiana cannot recommend a death sentence or life without parole unless they agree there is at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, the law says. Rape, burglary and dismemberment are among those aggravated circumstances. Oberhansley, now 34, was convicted of manslaughter in the 1998 shooting death of his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Sabrina Elder, in Salt Lake City just days after the birth of their son. He served 14 years behind bars for the crime and was discharged from parole on July 23 last year. Convict: In 1998, Oberhansley, then a teenager, was imprisoned for killing his 17-year-old girlfriend . On July 31, Tammy Jo Blanton posted his $500 bond for charges of criminal recklessness and resisting law enforcement stemming from a car chase. Then on September 11, she called 911 at around 3am to report that her jilted boyfriend was outside her home and would not leave, according to the probable cause affidavit. Officers arrived on the scene and ordered Oberhansley to leave after Blanton spoke to him outside. At around 10am that morning, police got another call, this time from Blanton's co-worker, asking them to perform a welfare check after she failed to show up for work. Police found that the back door had been forced open and inside, officers discovered Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the blood-spattered bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso. 'The front of the victim's skull appeared to have been crushed and brain tissue appeared scattered around the bathtub,' the affidavit stated. The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking utensils, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Scene: Oberhansley allegedly broke down Blanton's backdoor at her Jeffersonville home, pictured, and then forced his way into her bathroom, where she was hiding, and repeatedly stabbed her . When questioned by police, Oberhansley confessed to forcing his way into the bathroom, where Blanton had locked herself, and repeatedly stabbing her. Oberhansley told police he then used an electric jigsaw to open Blanton's skull and ate parts of her brain, heart and lungs. The blade was allegedly recovered from the scene after the grisly death. A trial date is expected to be set by the end of April.

{"document": "Anger: The UN said Katie Hopkins (pictured) used language similar to that of Rwandan media in the run up the 1994 genocide and by Nazis in the 1930s . The UN's rights chief has urged Britain to crack down on tabloid newspapers inciting racial hatred after a columnist for The Sun called migrants 'cockroaches'. In a hard-hitting statement, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Husein said Katie Hopkins had used language similar to that employed by some Rwandan media outlets in the run-up to the 1994 genocide, and by the Nazis in the 1930s. He said the April 17 article in the newspaper was reflective of a 'nasty underbelly of racism that is characterising the migration debate in an increasing number of EU countries'. This was also 'sapping compassion for the thousands of people fleeing conflict, human rights violations and economic deprivation who are drowning in the Mediterranean,' he said. The article came as migrant boat tragedies in the Mediterranean escalated. Already, more than 1,750 people have died this year making the perilous sea crossing to try to reach Europe - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014. Zeid asked British authorities, media, and regulatory bodies to take immediate steps to stop racial and inflammatory articles. 'This vicious verbal assault on migrants and asylum seekers in the UK tabloid press has continued unchallenged under the law for far too long,' he said. 'The Sun's editors took an editorial decision to publish this article, and - if it is found in breach of the law - should be held responsible along with the author.' The high commissioner said the Hopkins piece was 'simply one of the more extreme examples of thousands of anti-foreigner articles that have appeared in UK tabloids over the past two decades.' He also asked all European countries to take a firmer line on racism and xenophobia. Eritrean migrant Wegasi Nebiat is saved by rescuers after the wooden boat carrying her crashed off the popular Greek island of Rhodes . Death of a child: More than 1,750 people have already died this year making the perilous sea crossing to try to reach Europe - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 . Clinging on: Migrants trying to reach Greece are seen onboard a capsizing sailboat off the coast of Rhodes . 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches,' she wrote. 'They might look like 'Bob Geldof's Ethiopia circa 1984' but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb.' 'It is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers.' The columnist also said Europe should adopt a hardline approach to clandestine immigration like Australia by using navy ships to turn back boats carrying asylum seekers. 'Britain is not El Dorado,' Hopkins said. 'Some of our towns are festering sores, plagued by swarms of migrants and asylum seekers, shelling out benefits like Monopoly money.' Zeid said provocative articles could trigger dangerous reactions.

The provocative allegation has provoked a furious response from the Tories who this morning demanded that Mr Miliband apologise for the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. It comes after Mr Cameron held emergency talks with EU leaders in Brussels yesterday over how to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis. The Prime Minister announced the deployment of one of Britain's biggest warships - HMS Bulwark - as part of beefed-up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats. Up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach Europe this year - out of around 35,000 who have tried to make the crossing.

{"document": "North Sea cod stocks are bouncing back after being heavily overfished for decades and could even be sustainable in five years, new research has found. The population was deemed healthy in hundreds of the northern European fisheries analysed and experts say the fish is closer to being certified as a sustainable species. Consumers were previously told to eat gurnard instead of cod after stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s, but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006. North Sea cod stocks are on the rise after being heavily overfished and could be sustainable in five years . However the findings by Seafish and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) revealed that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably, with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management. The exact cod stock figures remain unknown due to a severe lack of scientific data on the number of fish caught every year, according to the Guardian. Dr Tom Pickerell, technical director at industry-funded Seafish, which represents the seafood industry, told the paper he was surprised at how close the North Sea cod is to being certified. He said: 'I would like to think within a decade we will have MSC-certified North Sea cod. I would like to put it closer – where within five years it could look at entering the system.' Cod stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s, but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006 . The findings by Seafish and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) did reveal however that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably, with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management . Although eight out of nine fisheries fell short Dr Pickerell remains optimistic, adding: 'It's a question of glass half full or half empty. Trawling in the North Sea saw catches grow each year until the 1980s, with figures for cod peaking at 300,000 tonnes in the 1970s. Various regulations were put in place to protect the stocks of fish, including limited fishing times and limited numbers of fishing boats. But these rules were never systematically enforced and did not bring much relief. After the UK joined the EU, which introduced the Common Fisheries Policy, the problem of overfishing was steadily brought under control. Numbers fell to below 70,000 tonnes for the first time in 1999 and reached its lowest level of 28,900 tonnes in 2006. A report in 2012 suggested that there were only 100 adult cod, which become more fertile as they age, left in the North Sea. Researchers warned a lower life expectancy meant a lower birth rate and a faster decline. But in 2013 the first signs of recovery started to show as the Marine Stewardship Council recognised cod could be on track for certification. 'We are looking at it as glass half full because we now have an action plan. We would have been in the dark without this research.' The research included 450 inshore fisheries, which were assessed against the criteria set out by the MSC to be considered for its 'blue flash' logo. This logo is seen as an indicator for consumers that the seafood comes from sustainable fisheries. Toby Middleton, country manager at the MSC, said the report highlights a 'lack of clarity' on who was responsible for maintaining the fisheries as too many fell between different authorities. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said it recognises stocks are recovering and that there are 'positive signs' but still regards it as a species to avoid. The MCS still lists cod caught in the North Sea as 'fish to avoid', rating it at level 5. It explains that stock levels in the North Sea have declined from a peak of 250,000 tonnes in the early 1970s to their current level of around 70,000 tonnes. Atlantic cod is listed by OSPAR (The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) as a threatened and declining species and by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Sea. 'The efforts of fishers and managers through the Conservation Credits Scheme, and the fact that there is a long term management plan in place, are very positive moves and will hopefully see the fishery continue to recover in the coming years,' it says.

{"document": "Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)Martin O'Malley told reporters in Iowa on Friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton -- is not unbreakable. \"I've seen it before,\" the former Governor of Maryland and possible presidential contender said. \"History is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable.\" Clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to Barack Obama. O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month. The former governor, who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines, said that although Clinton is an \"eminently qualified candidate,\" the Democratic Party is full of \"good leaders.\" \"History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa,\" O'Malley said. In some polls, he has scored in the low single digits in the state. In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1% picked O'Malley. In a January poll by Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, O'Malley was also at 1% among Iowa Democrats. Clinton, who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points, is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told CNN on Friday.

And they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it.\" O'Malley, like other Democrats, appears to refrain from directly attacking Clinton. Although last month on ABC, he said that the presidency is \"not some crown to be passed between two families,\" he has not focused on her. He has, however, openly teased a presidential run. \"I know that, as Democrats, we expect -- and I have heard this all over the country -- the Democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face,\" he said. \"They believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary.\" He concluded: \"It would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party's nomination for President.\"", "summary": "He made the statement before in March .\nO'Malley is low in the polls with Democrats, but he has been flirting with a presidential run ."}
{"document": "A veteran has described the hurt he felt after being disrespected by a mob of University of Florida fraternity members during a charity weekend that honors wounded heroes in Panama Beach City. The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was suspended Friday and charged with obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft, causing physical or other harm, and damage to property for allegedly disrespecting disabled veterans by spitting on them, shouting verbal abuse and even urinating on the American flag. The deplorable behavior against the ex-servicemen occurred at the Warrior Beach Retreat on April 17. 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts,' wounded veteran Nicholas Connole, who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq, told WJHG. 'I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself.' Scroll down for video . 'Hurt': Nicholas Connole, a wounded veteran who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq, said both he and his dog were spat on by university students in Panama Beach City for a spring formal . Disrespected: The soldier, seen here with his wife, said he felt like he had to 'defend himself' against the students, who threw beers and spat from their balconies . Scene: The students were staying here at the Warrior Beach Retreat. The abuse occurred mostly when servicemen were walking past . Allegations: Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida (pictured) and Emory University have been accused of disrespecting the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. It is not know whether anyone in this picture was involved . Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, says she's never seen such disgusting behavior. 'They're a total disgrace for our military,' she told the network. 'They were urinating on the American flag they were throwing things off of the balconies.' The veterans were staying at the Lake Town Wharf Resort and the students were in town for their spring formal. 'I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,' said Cope. 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, founder of the warrior group, says the frat members were urinating on flags and verbally abusive . Happier times: Nicholas Connole is seen here proposing to his now-wife in a photo from his Facebook. The returned soldier was wounded while serving, but was abused while attending a charity event . Emory University have now finally commented on the incident. In a statement a spokesman said that while they were 'appalled' at what happened, there was 'no evidence  found to implicate Emory students in these reported incidents'. 'If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university,' the statement continued. Hope said that the statement was a 'slap in the face to veterans'. 'There were too many students from Emory for none of them to be involved,' she said. 'It is hard for me to believe that no Emory student was a part of this.' According to reports the police were called and the hotel security responded. They managed to get the situation under control and some of the students involved were thrown out of the hotel, but no arrests were made. Haley Riley, who was attending the event with her wounded husband, said beer bottles were thrown at them and students threw up in the elevators. About 60 veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were also attending a retreat that has been held twice a year for the past six years at the resort. Cope started the event in honor of her son Joshua, who lost both legs in Baghdad in 2006 when a roadside bomb exploded under his Humvee. Zeta Beta Tau International confirmed that three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled from the fraternity and both university chapters have suspended all activities. However they are still investigating what has happened. The branch at the campus in Gainsville, Florida, is already under 'conduct probation' following an alleged hazing incident. A spokesman representing the nationwide fraternity said: 'Early this week our Fraternity was made aware of reports regarding an incident between several members of two of our chapters and veterans of the Warrior Beach Retreat during independent trips to Panama City Beach. 'While the details of their actions are still under investigation, there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior. Their actions have no place in ZBT or anywhere, and they will not be tolerated. Repercussions: Three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled. The branch was already under conduct probation following an alleged hazing incident . 'On behalf of our entire organization, I want to apologize to veterans, both those who were in Panama City Beach, and those who have felt the pain from afar, as well as to their families and all who support the Warrior Beach Retreat and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees. 'I am deeply saddened that the actions of our members ruined this special event and failed to show the respect our military and their families so deserve. 'As we continue our investigation, our chapters at the University of Florida and Emory University have suspended all activities and are fully cooperating in our investigation. In addition, we have already expelled three members of the University of Florida chapter from our organization who we found to have been behaving inappropriately, and we will take any further action necessary as we learn more. 'Our Fraternity also has issued an apology on behalf of all of our members to the Warrior Beach Retreat, the organization that was hosting the veterans to provide them and their families with the opportunity to relax and recharge. 'We are honored that hundreds of our ZBT brothers have served in the military and are disgusted that certain members of our Fraternity failed to exhibit the behaviors we expect from them towards our nation's heroes — respect, gratitude and honor. 'We are committed to fully addressing the events that took place, and will be hiring an independent investigator to help us gather all of the facts. Short-term, we are actively working with the resort, with the Presidents of both universities and with the local police to fully understand the events that took place. In all instances, we have a zero tolerance policy towards this type of behavior and are committed to appropriately disciplining any members of our Fraternity who were involved. 'We also look forward to working with our members to make amends for this disgraceful situation by identifying opportunities to serve those who have done so much to serve us.' University of Florida President Kent Fuchs has personally apologized for the behavior of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity members toward the veterans. Probe: Officials at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has deplored the actions and is investigating whether any of their students were involved. However they are yet to find any evidence tying the branch's fraternity members to the deplorable behavior in Panama City . In an email to Cope, he wrote: 'The incidents and behavior you and others have described (in letters and phone calls) and the offense to the wounded warriors and other guests are unacceptable. 'We are pursuing an investigation of the matter to learn more about the involvement of University of Florida students and whether disciplinary action will be needed.' Cope responded by saying: 'I said do your investigating, but I want to know what you're going to do. What are you going to do? I think they all should be put on probation. I'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain.' The fraternity's mission statement on its website reads: 'Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships within the Jewish community. It reads: 'Since 1954, ZBT has been committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and initiate men of good character, regardless of religion, race or creed who are accepting of these principles.'", "summary": "Zeta Beta Tau suspended and charged for the 'disgusting' acts .\nThree members were expelled for the deplorable acts at the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama Beach City on April 17 .\nEvent designed to give ex-servicemen a relaxing break .\nUniversity of Florida and Emory University branches were there at the time .\nThey allegedly ripped flags off cars and urinated on them and threw items off balconies .\nWounded veteran Nicholas Connole said he was spat on and felt 'hurt'"}
{"document": "Part of a fiberglass boat spotted floating off the coast of Oregon is thought to be more debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The 25-ft long wreckage was discovered floating west of Ona Beach in Lincoln County at about 9.30am on Thursday. Biologists with the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the boat remains and and found 'several live specimens of a variety of yellowtail jack fish found in the coastal waters of Japan.' Tsunami debris: A chunk of a fiberglass boat 25-30' long has been spotted floating off the Oregon shore . Rescued: These live yellowtail jack fish, native to Japan, were found inside the floating debris and are now being housed in the Oregon Coast Aquarium . The several live yellowtail jack fish found on board will be delivered to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes, boats, and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern Japan - were swallowed by the ocean when the tsunami struck four years ago. About 70 per cent of it sank, leaving about 1.5 million tons floating with scientists saying they expect more debris to hit Alaska and the West Coast of North America for years to come. An estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in March of 2011 during the tsunami. Around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the Japanese coast. Some more mobile items may have reached the Pacific Northwest before 2011 even came to a close. The first documented piece of debris to arrive in California, a barnacle covered fishing boat, came ashore in April 2013. The particles are dispersed sparsely from Alaska to the Philippines. In 2013, a floating island of debris the size of Texas crossed the vast Pacific Ocean to the western shores of the Americas. The Oregan authorities plan to tow the boat segment to the Port of Newport for temporary storage. 'The debris appears to be half to two-thirds of a larger vessel, possibly damaged and set adrift during the earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan in 2011,' said Chris Havel of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. He said biologists inspected the object and consulted with the state Fish and Wildlife Department, deciding that the attached organisms pose little threat to the Oregon coast ecosystem.

{"document": "Retired news legend Barbara Walters still has some clout - and a strong opinion about how ABC can turn things around at the ratings-challenged show she created, The View. Barbara's magic bullet: Monica Lewinsky. Walters says that the former White House intern would be a 'run away success' on The View, a network source tells Daily Mail Online. She would attract great guests - even if casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or President Bill Clinton would ever appear on the show again. Scroll down for video . Ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal Barbara Walters has always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years . Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern talked about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. 'Barbara believes that Monica, 41, could make The View competitive and compelling and while a lot of Washington's elite may scratch the show off its must-visit press list, the younger demographic of online users would tune in daily to see what she had to say,' added the source. Last year when discussing Lewinsky with David Letterman, he asked her about Monica joining The View. It looked as though the late night host was reading her mind and she stuttered, 'I think it would be great if she were on The View. I wouldn't expect it tomorrow.' 'Tomorrow is now,' says the insider. The multi-host show was created by Walters in 1997 with an original panel of women including Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It defied the odds previous shows faced in the 11am time slot. Exit Rosie: She had enough of The View and vice versa . Despite numerous cast changes – Lisa Ling, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Rosie O'Donnell, Sherri Shepherd, and Jenny McCarthy have had stints as co-hosts on the show – The View became a force to be reckoned with in daytime TV. But after the exit of Behar and Hasselbeck and the addition of McCarthy, The View took a ratings dive. ABC decided to overhaul the show following the end of that season, and replaced Shepherd and McCarthy with Republican analyst Nicolle Wallace and actress Rosie Perez. The network also brought back O'Donnell to join the show's long-running moderator, Whoopi Goldberg. In-fighting between Goldberg and O'Donnell and endless backstage turmoil caused ABC to move the show from its Entertainment division to its News division. Despite numerous set changes and multiple updates to the show opening, the new ensemble never seemed to attract viewers and ratings continued to fall. ABC then had a failed attempt at firing Perez while she was rehearing for her Broadway show Fish in the Dark in January. In February, after the return of Goldberg who had been sidelined with a back injury, ABC let O'Donnell go but allowed her to use her recent divorce as her excuse for departing the show for a second time. (She had a failed one-year stint as moderator in 2007 that abruptly ended after she walked off set following an on-air blow-up with co-host Hasselbeck.) Down to three co-hosts and two chairs vacant, ABC has been closely looking at Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams, fashion host Stacy London, former child star Raven Symone and comedienne Michelle Collins as potential replacements. President Bill Clinton appeared on The View in 2011 talking about his book Back to Work and the current economic troubles occurring in America. It is doubtful he would be a guest if Monica was co-host . The View celebratesd 4000 shows with guest co-hosts Barbara Walters and Joy Behar . The network is also seriously considering convincing former co-host Behar to return as a full-time panelist. She has made a half-dozen co-host appearances since January and was on-hand for the show's 4,000-episode celebration show. Walters, who sold all rights to The View back to ABC a year before her retirement in May 2014, has been contacting James Goldston, President of ABC News, and Ben Sherwood, President, Disney-ABC Television Group, trying to convince them to hire Lewinsky, insiders tell Daily Mail Online. Walters believes that Lewinsky could reignite interest in the show and after a decade-long silence; she has a lot to say. 'Barbara has been like a godmother to Monica ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal. She's always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years,' a source close to the show says. Barbara told Letterman, 'I like Monica. She never had a chance to move on,' the way Bill and Hillary did. 'She's an intelligent, nice woman.' Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern spoke about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. Barbara Walters, arrives for the Oscar De La Renta fashion show last February. She remains spry and opinionated too. She's convinced Monica would help save the show . Not only that, but since re-emerging out of the shadows to address her affair with Clinton in a compelling Vanity Fair essay last May, she has taken on an extremely attractive new look to match her new persona. According to a representative of the show, Lewinsky has been asked to come on the show as a guest to discuss her anti-bullying campaign but is not on the list of potential co-hosts at this time. While current co-host Wallace would love to have Lewinsky as a regular on the show, staunch Democratic supporters and Clinton friends Goldberg and Perez aren't feeling the idea at all, the source revealed. A few weeks ago The Talk managed to edge out The View in the Nielsen ratings, but The View has come back to beat out the relative newcomer ever since. 'Whatever ABC News plans to do to salvage the show, they better do it fast,' the source concluded!", "summary": "The grand dame of broadcasters believes that Monica Lewinsky has the right stuff to bring The View back from the brink .\nThe former White House intern would also draw great guests - although probably not Hillary or Bill Clinton .\nHer recent TED Talk on 'The Price of Fame 'redefines her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying .\nIn recent weeks Nielsen ratings showed that The Talk beat out The View for the first time but The View made a comeback ."}
{"document": "This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing  their tears dripping into a cup. A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online  as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. She wrote on Facebook last week: ‘Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you’ve been invited and you’re a man and/or white PLEASE DON’T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.’ Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: ‘Don’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do’, followed by a wink. The event’s online page said it was open to ‘self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “woman”.’ A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’ and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People . The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'. The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote ‘zero tolerance’ for ‘all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression’. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students. In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’, also organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People. Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best \"them\" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a £450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: ‘We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. ‘We have written to the students’ union to express our concern.’ The union said: ‘Goldsmiths Students’ Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. ‘It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. ‘The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control .", "summary": "Elected diversity officer Bahar Mustafa caught in racism and sexism row .\nFacebook picture shows her faking tears in front of a 'no white men' sign .\nShe was criticised after planning  diversity meeting that banned white men .\nGoldsmiths University students arranged meeting to 'diversify curriculum'"}
{"document": "Such has been the volatility at the top of the Championship this season that predicting future outcomes has proved a futile exercise, but what is certain is that Middlesbrough hold the aces. With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for £2million in January. Afobe has made himself instantly at home and has Leeds in his sights today. Final word to the English forward: 'Every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won.' Welcome to the Championship rat race.

The video taken in the forecourt of the Sunoco gas station on North 5th Street in Philadelphia shows five people, including two children, storming out of a minivan and attacking the helpless 51-year-old. One of the group takes out Mace as the man is brought to the ground. They then stamp on his head and continue punching him as he lies motionless. The encounter is believed to have been caused by a 10-year-old boy telling his mother the homeless man hit him - an allegation police have found no evidence of during their investigation. The video taken in the forecourt of the Sunoco gas station on North 5th Street in Philadelphia shows five people, including two children, storming out of a minivan and attacking the helpless 51-year-old. The encounter is believed to have been caused by a 10-year-old boy telling his mother the homeless man hit him . The youngster accused the man of jockeying with him while asking to fill motorist's tanks for spare change. At the end of the video he is brought out of the car so he can look at the injuries inflicted on the victim, as he lies bloodied on the floor. The boy's mother, 34-year-old Aleathea Gillard, allegedly used the rocking chair leg while close family friend, Shareena Joachim, 24, is said to have carried the Mace. The pair were arrested and charged with attempted murder and related crimes. Lieutenant Dan Brooks of Northwest Detectives said: 'Just watching, you see the viciousness of it.'

{"document": "Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals.

In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months.

'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat.

Tierney, who joined Bolton from Norwich, was set for a call up to the Republic of Ireland squad prior to his injury. Bolton defender Marc Tierney has been forced to take early retirement following a long-term ankle injury . Tierney started his career at Oldham Athletic in 2003 , rising through the ranks at the club's academy and making 44 appearances for the first-team, before a switch to Shrewsbury Town four years later. He spent another four years at Shrewsbury, with one of those a loan spell at Colchester United.

{"document": "A nurse who faced surgery to treat breast cancer at the hospital where she worked discovered just days later that she'd never had the disease. A mix-up at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients. As a result, Elizabeth Dawes was wrongly told in July 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer following a biopsy. Doctors advised the 39-year-old that she needed immediate surgery, suggesting a double mastectomy. Ms Dawes refused, but did undergo major surgery to remove a 'cancerous' tumour from her right breast as well as lymph nodes from her armpit. Elizabeth Dawes, 39, was told she had breast cancer in July 2013. Doctors at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton told her she needed immediate surgery and chemotherapy. But four days after the operation she was told staff had confused her medical notes with those of other patients, and she'd never had cancer . The mother-of-one was also told she would need a further procedure to correct 'deformities' to her breasts caused by the first operation. But four days later, Ms Dawes was asked to attend an appointment with her consultant. There, he revealed there had been a mix-up with her hospital notes and those of two other patients, - and she had, in fact, never had the disease. She said: 'I am absolutely appalled at what I have been through and am still struggling to comprehend how this could even happen. 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order.' 'I was willing to undergo whatever treatment it took to fight the cancer so when I was told I needed surgery, I didn't think twice.' Ms Dawes was so traumatised she needed anti-depressants and was forced to give up her job in the oncology department at New Cross Hospital. , added: 'The doctor also told me I would need a bilateral breast lift to cosmetically improve the shape of my breasts, as otherwise, after having the cancer surgery I would be left deformed. 'I was very sore after the operation and shocked by the extensive scaring, so to be recalled four days later to be told none of it was necessary was truly horrendous. 'I am still in pain now, have lost a lot of sensation in my breasts and the scarring has not improved, which hugely affects my self-confidence. 'Nothing can make up for what has happened but I am determined to see justice done and feel I at least deserve an official apology from the Trust given the huge impact this has had on my life.' Ms Dawes, who has an 18-year-old son, is taking legal action. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability for the misdiagnosis and the unnecessary surgery performed. The mother-of-one, who was working as a breast cancer care nurse at the same hospital at the time, said: 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order' Lawyer Louise Hawkley, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This is a truly shocking case that has left Elizabeth appalled at the unnecessary heartache, and extensive scarring she has suffered as a result of being wrongly told that she had breast cancer. 'There are also very serious patient safety concerns about the \"mix-up\" and how the other patients have potentially been affected too.' She said aside from the 'obvious physical implications', the ordeal has had 'a devastating impact' on her client's life. Ms Dawes had worked as a breast care nurse in the Oncology Department at New Cross Hospital but has since found herself unable to continue in her role 'as a consequence of what she has been through'. Ms Hawkley added: 'It is also vital that the Trust identifies what improvements can be made to ensure that this never happens again to improve patient safety at the hospital.' A trust spokesman told MailOnline it has apologised to Ms Dawes and carried out a full investigation. He said: 'The medical director and nurse director met with Ms Dawes to offer her an unreserved apology for this terrible error and inform her of the trust’s investigation into the incident. 'The findings of the investigation were shared with Ms Dawes and a further apology offered at that time. 'The incident is now part of an ongoing legal claim with which the trust is co-operating fully. 'The trust can confirm that no other patient received inappropriate treatment as a result of this incident.'

As people lay candles by the sea in Valetta, Malta, an equally emotional memorial service was taking place in front of Rome's Verano Cemetery. The deadliest migrant tragedy on the Mediterranean so far took this year's death toll on the waters to a staggering 1,800. It came as three other people - including a tiny child - died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes. And the relentless tide of migrants escaping the war-torn country of Libya has continued since the tragic wreck this weekend. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece. But an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels today will announce that only 5,000 refugees who survive the perilous journey will be granted safe haven in Europe and the rest will be sent back, the Guardian has reported.

Italy's coast guard rescued another 220 migrants from two large rubber boats around 40 miles from the Libyan coast yesterday. Another 545 - many of whom were not even wearing shoes - were taken to the port of Salerno just south of Naples. A further 446 migrants of Egyptian, Syrian, Sudanese, Somalian and Eritrean origin arrived in Sicily after being rescued from a rickety fishing vessel. The memorial service in Malta's capital Valetta honoured the 24 bodies recovered from Sunday's disaster when the smugglers' boat capsized near Libya with hundreds trapped inside. Only 28 people were rescued and the bodies of most of the desperate migrants were never recovered. Two survivors were arrested as they stepped onto Sicilian soil - 24 hours after their boat capsized -killing around 900 people in one of the worst maritime tragedies in recent history. One was the boat's Tunisian captain was charged with multiple manslaughter and the other his Syrian crew member. Both were questioned on the long journey from Libya to Sicily last night before being taken into custody and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration'. EU leaders will decide how to deal with the migrant crisis during an emergency summit in Brussels today. But a 'confidential draft summit statement' seen by the Guardian reveals that only 5,000 resettlement places across Europe will be offered to refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa. The rest will be sent back as 'irregular migrants' under a new rapid return programme coordinated by the EU's border agency Frontex. It also revealed that there would be no expansion to search and rescue operations around the Libyan coast despite widespread and aggressive pressure for better provisions.

Meanwhile, flowers blanket a room in Valetta's Mater Dei Hospital morgue and a touching note attached to one bouquet read: 'R.I.P. brothers and sisters. You matter.' A visibly emotional Navy Lieutenant said: 'We proceeded out at sea with the hope of course to save as many people as we could but unfortunately we didn't arrive quite in time to save the migrants. Mark Merceica added: 'We were really disappointed and you could feel this through the entire crew, we were really hoping to arrive in time.' An Italian search and rescue mission that saved the lives of over 100,000 migrants in the Mediterranean last year was shut down because EU nations refused to pay for it. It was replaced with a smaller EU scheme which focused on patrolling the coast line after some countries argued that saving migrants would encourage more to make the perilous journey. Many European politicians have acknowledged this week that last year's decision not to replace the Italian search and rescue operation was a mistake. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, which has borne the brunt of caring for the migrants, wants other EU countries to do more to fund efforts to rescue and settle those who make it across. Many EU countries still believe search and rescue operations alone will not solve the problem and more must be done to fight traffickers. Wreck: Local men on the Greek island of Rhodes waded into the surf to save migrants on a rickety wooden boat filled with migrants that had run aground . Death: Three people died in the tragedy, among them a tiny boy (pictured) whose body was seen being carried to land on a white paddle boat . Coward: Later survivors (pictured) told Sky News their captain had simply 'run away' when he lost control of the boat . The smugglers have taken advantage of lawlessness in Libya to set up operations that exported 170,000 migrants across the sea last year. One of the proposals leaders will discuss in Brussels is a military mission to capture and destroy traffickers' boats. Italy's Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti has said: 'We know where the boats are, where the smugglers gather together the people who are fleeing.' And EU officials have drawn comparisons with operations to crack down on Somali pirates, with one senior member saying: 'We are determined to destroy their business model. The leaders will also discuss a pilot project to resettle 5,000 to 10,000 refugees from Mediterranean countries to other EU states. The United Nations estimates 36,000 have made the voyage so far this year. An unprecedented 10,000 refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa have been rescued by Italian ships in the past week.

{"document": "Manchester City have told Jason Denayer they want him to spend next season in the English Championship. The Belgian defender has been a revelation during his year-long loan move to Celtic. Already a PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year nominee, the Belgian scooped the same honour at Celtic’s annual awards dinner in Glasgow on Sunday. The 19-year-old had consistently stated he intended returning to his parent club this summer to fight for a first-team place but last week changed his tune to give Ronny Deila some hope of retaining his services for another season. Jason Denayer is set to return to England to spend a season on loan in the Championship . At the time, Denayer said: ‘Of course I would be happy to do that. I’ve had a very good year here so far. ‘I would be happy to come back but I will need to wait until the summer to see what is happening. I prefer just to focus on the present.’ Sportsmail understands, however, that City will block any move by Celtic to instigate another one-year deal. Although they feel Denayer isn’t quite ready to push for a first-team place at the Etihad, they want to see him spend a year in the English second tier in order to complete his footballing apprenticeship. The on-loan Manchester City defender has been in impressive form for Celtic since joining the club . The player recently become a full Belgian international – stepping into the breach when Vincent Kompany was red carded during a 1-0 win against Israel in a Euro 2016 qualifier. With Virgil van Dijk very much on Southampton’s radar, Deila faces the prospect of losing both of his centre-halves before the Champions League qualifiers begin in July. Celtic striker John Guidetti, meanwhile, will discover on Thursday if he is to be punished for singing an allegedly ‘offensive’ song about the demise of Old Firm rivals Rangers. Ronny Deila will be disappointed to lose Denayer and he could lose Virgil van Dijk (right) as well . Guidetti was issued with a notice of complaint last month after giving an interview to Dutch TV show FC Rijnmond. It is not clear if Guidetti will appear before the Hampden panel at Thursday’s re-arranged hearing but Celtic have already backed the player. In a statement issued last month, a spokesman for the Parkhead outfit said: ‘We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel. John Guidetti will be defending this charge.’ John Guidetti faces disciplinary action after singing an offensive song about rivals Rangers . Guidetti made a sensational start to his Celtic switch, scoring 11 goals in his first 12 games after moving north from the Etihad Stadium. But his form has been patchy since and he was left on the bench by boss Ronny Deila on Sunday as the Hoops took another step towards their fourth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with a 3-0 Tannadice win over Dundee United.", "summary": "Defender Jason Denayer will not be returning to Celtic next season .\nManchester City have decided he should play Championship football .\nDenayer nominated for the PFA Scotland Player of the Year award .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Celtic news ."}
{"document": "Labour's plans to change rules allowing wealthy foreigners to lower their tax bills is causing London property deals to fall through and homeowners to sell up, estate agents have claimed. Ed Miliband initially suggested he would 'abolish' the non-domicile status on Wednesday should his party take power in the General Election on May 7, but it later emerged he is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years. Although Labour aides suggested this would raise as much as £1billion, it seems the announcement has already had a negative impact on the capital's property market. Scroll down for video . Rule change: Ed Miliband joined crowds in Warwick, where he announced his non-dom plans on Wednesday . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. Ed Mead, executive director of London-based estate agents Douglas & Gordon, said there has been a huge increase in valuations because of Wednesday's announcement - 37 in a month compared to the usual figure of about six. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'These are people who are saying \"we have finally had enough and we are going to value with a view to selling up and leaving\". 'These people spend a lot of money in the economy. I do very much fear for the top end of the market.' It's claimed the announcement has already had a negative impact on the capital's property market . Mr Mead, who has been working in the London property market for 35 years, explained it's not just the top end that will be affected. He added: 'The London market is unique - it's pulled from the top up. 'If you cut strings that's holding the market up, everything else falls down.' Charles McDowell, an independent agent hired by rich families in the capital, told the Financial Times that two deals he was involved in had fallen through this week because of Ed Miliband's non-doms plan, while two families asked him to sell their homes. He told the paper: 'My clients feel under attack, they are not going to invest in London any more.' Non-doms must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home, but Mr Miliband argues that the tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Newspaper reports suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But  it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on. Luxury property: Ed Mead, executive director of London-based estate agents Douglas & Gordon, said there has been a huge increase in valuations because of Wednesday's announcement . One Hyde Park: Mr Mead says he fears for the top end of the market but 'if you cut strings that's holding the market up, everything else falls down' In his speech, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. 'It is not fair. It is not just. It holds Britain back. We will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule,' he said. The Tories pointed out that a five-year grace period would exempt up to six in every ten non-doms from the crackdown anyway, because many do not stay longer than five years. Tax advisers say driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Within hours of announcing the policy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was forced to admit he did not actually know how much extra cash the measure would raise. In a further embarrassment, it later emerged that just three months ago he himself had said such a move would be counter-productive – saying it would result in the country losing money. In a video that emerged yesterday, Mr Balls can be seen telling a local BBC radio station that abolishing the status altogether 'will probably end up costing Britain money because some people will leave the country'.", "summary": "Labour plans to change rules that allow foreigners to lower their tax bills .\nNon-doms only pay tax on their UK income, not earnings from overseas .\nEstate agents claim non-doms are selling up and deals are falling through ."}
{"document": "Disgraced former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell made his final written plea to a federal appeals court Wednesday, arguing that the favors he did for a wealthy businessman were routine courtesies and not part of a bribery scheme. The onetime rising Republican star made the argument in a 54-page brief in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel of the court will conduct a hearing on his appeal of his public corruption convictions on May 12. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell fought back tears outside a federal court building after he was sentenced for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company . McDonnell was sentenced to two years in federal prison for public corruption . McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's nutritional supplements. Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day, but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals. 'Governor McDonnell never promised anything and never did anything besides extend to Williams the sorts of routine courtesies elected officials throughout the country extend to donors and benefactors every day,' McDonnell's lawyers wrote in the latest filing. They were responding to the government's brief urging the court to uphold the criminal convictions. Former first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, was sentenced to a year and a day . Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under an immunity deal, admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his 'miracle cure' Anatabloc product . Prosecutors had written in a 93-page submission to the court that McDonnell's actions fit the definition of 'official acts' even better than those taken by former Louisiana Rep. William Jefferson, who is serving 13 years in prison for taking bribes in exchange for using his influence to broker business deals with government leaders in Africa. Jefferson was famously caught with $100,000 in bribe money hidden in his freezer. 'Here, defendant directed his action toward subordinate state employees within the branch of government that he controlled as governor,' they wrote, while in the Jefferson case 'a congressman took action through meetings, letters, and the like directed at other government agencies or foreign governments.' One of McDonnell's chief claims on appeal is that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law. In the new filing, he argues that a meeting McDonnell arranged for Williams with an administration official was 'innocuous' and that there was nothing special about an event at the Executive Mansion to launch Star's signature product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. 'Governor McDonnell arrived late, made neutral comments, and left. He never asked anyone to do anything for Williams,' the brief says. Star Scientific, the maker of Anatabloc, the anti-inflammatory supplement at the center of the McDonnell trial, halted sales of the product in August 2014 . Worse than the freezer bribes? Prosecutors argue McDonnell's behavior was a better fit with bribery laws than that of convicted former congressman William Jefferson, who his $100,000 of his bribe cash in his freezer . McDonnell argues that in addition to mischaracterizing such events as 'official acts,' the government incorrectly suggested that McDonnell kept his staff in the dark about most of Williams' gifts. Among the gifts were almost $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell, vacations, golf outings and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding. The former governor also renewed claims that the judge improperly denied separate trials for Bob and Maureen McDonnell and that he failed to adequately question jurors about pretrial news coverage.

{"document": "(CNN)The reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun, and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot, were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect, according to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, investigator. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, \"inadvertently\" shot Eric Courtney Harris after Harris -- a possibly PCP-addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting. As deputies tried to handcuff Harris, Bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand. He warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a Taser on the suspect, but instead, he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized, Clark said, citing a recently released video. Clark attributed Bates' actions to a phenomenon known as \"slip and capture.\" An example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission. The driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly, even though there's no clutch pedal, he said. Quoting Bill Lewinski, executive director of the Force Science Institute, Clark further explained: \"These are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another, and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended. In effect, your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction.\" Bates announced that he was going to deploy his Taser, and he pulled the trigger only once, as he was trained to do, Clark said. Police are trained to \"double-tap\" when firing their handguns, he said. The gun jumped out of Bates' hand because he wasn't expecting recoil, Clark said, and Bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot Harris. Quoting Lewinski again, Clark said, \"This is the slip and capture. Under time pressure to address a perceived threat, his intention to draw his Taser slipped off his agenda, so to speak, when it was captured and completed by a more well-rehearsed motor program. ... He was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired. In his urgency, his concentration was focused exclusively on Harris' back, where he intended to place the Taser darts. Because of what's called 'inattentional blindness,' meaning that he wasn't consciously paying attention to and registering it, he wouldn't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the Taser. And in this case the weight of the gun and Taser are nearly identical.\" Clark was emphatic that Bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim. \"Reserve Deputy Bates did not commit a crime. Reserve Deputy Bates was a victim, a true victim of slip and capture,\" he said. \"There's no other determination I could come to.\" When they set up the undercover sting, police wanted evidence on camera. But when they recorded the operation targeting Harris earlier this month, cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran, and as he was fatally shot. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office released the video on Friday. The shooting was an apparent accident, it has said. In the last minutes of the video, Harris lies on the pavement with police on top of him. An officer calls for a Taser, but in place of an electric clicking sound, a gunshot rings out. A voice can be heard saying, \"Oh! I shot him! I'm sorry!\"  Another officer screams out, \"He shot him! He shot him!\" Harris, who is bleeding, calls out, too. He's losing his breath, he says. An officer yells back at him. \"You f**king ran! Shut the f**k up!\" he yells. \"F**k your breath,\" he said. Clark defended the officer's language, saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion, never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running. The language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified, Clark said. \"One deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site. It's very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone's life and this deputy, one of the involved deputies, was upset,\" he said. \"Secondly, this is total stress. They are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed.\" Clark added, \"They did not know that he was shot at this time. They had audio exclusion. They was at a point where they couldn't hear. They didn't even hear the gunshot go off. The officers did not know that Mr. Harris had been shot.\" An officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from Harris. Shortly after the suspect is shot, the officers begin tugging Harris' hands behind his back as the video ends. Harris later died at a local hospital. Police said at the time of the shooting that Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine, a street drug commonly known as PCP. The video is edited to block out the officers' faces. Harris is clearly visible. Minutes earlier, Harris had climbed into a truck cab, where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect. \"What's up?\" they greet each other cordially. Without missing a beat, Harris rummages deep in a backpack and hastily hands over a semiautomatic pistol. Every few seconds, he looks around outside nervously. \"Sweet, that's a nice gun, man,\" the undercover officer says off camera. It's a \"German Luger,\" Harris tells him. He cranes his head around quickly and watches as a car pulls up next to the truck. Officers in uniform jump out, and Harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off. \"He's running; he's running, he's running!\" the officer in the truck says. As Harris fled, police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip, \"consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun,\" Clark said, adding that no gun was found when Harris was searched after the chase. Another video from an officer's body camera picks up the chase. The officer wearing it jumps out of a vehicle and pursues Harris on foot, catching up to him easily. He tackles the fleeing suspect. The officer commands him, \"I need you to roll on your stomach. Now!\" Other officers appear. Someone calls, \"Taser! Taser!\" The gun discharges. Much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck, two men are conversing. \"He thought it was his Taser,\" one of them says, as the other curses in frustration. In the background, a woman is crying \"No, no, no!\" Harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion. Police have said that Harris had reached for his waistband, and officers feared he might endanger them. When Harris was on the ground, he \"refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband,\" they said after the shooting. The officer's body camera video did not reveal that area of Harris' body. Bates, a former Tulsa police officer, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, the sheriff's office has said. Asked whether Bates' age may have been a factor in the shooting, Clark said, \"It's happened to 21-year-old law enforcement officers. It's happened to 30-year-old law enforcement officers. Age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events. Despite the details released over the weekend, Harris' brother says he still want answers. \"I want to know if he was shot in the back accidentally or on purpose. These are all the things that not only I want, but the public wants,\" Andre Harris told CNN affiliate KTUL. Bates' attorney, Scott Wood, told CNN on Friday he would contact the network later. He had not issued a statement or called back as of Sunday. CNN's Jason Morris, Carma Hassan and Andreas Preuss contributed to this report.", "summary": "\"Slip and capture\" explains why deputy shot suspect, investigator says .\nSheriff's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a Taser .\nInstead, he shot the suspect, who later died at a local hospital ."}

{"document": "Heavy-duty: The drill that was used by thieves during the brazen £60million Hatton Garden heist . This is the drill that was used by thieves during the £60million Hatton Garden heist over the Easter weekend. The gang used the power tool to cut through the  wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems. The photograph of the Hilti DD350 drill was released tonight by Scotland Yard  as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an 'Ocean's 11 type team'. Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid. The six men were captured on CCTV as they carried out the bold raid in London's diamond district. They used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank's strongroom, where they ransacked security vaults. But, amazingly, the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement. Images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in London's diamond district. Safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty Hilti DD350 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby. Scotland Yard also described how there was rubbish covering the Hatton Garden basement, while the wrought-iron cage door had been broken down. An angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes. Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building, indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. One of the theories behind the  heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company is housed in a seven-storey building, which accommodates 60 other businesses, including watch traders and diamond wholesalers. The thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor, before using the lift shaft - which was destroyed when police officers arrived at the scene - to climb down to the vault. Breaking in: The gang used the power tool to cut through the concrete wall of the secured vault, pictured . Caught on CCTV: Scotland Yard previously released several images of the gang as they entered the premises . Reward: Police are offering a £20k reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal . Unaware: The men had their faces covered, but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera . They then opened shutter doors into the basement, before boring holes into the basement wall. Appearing on the BBC's Crimewatch tonight, Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of the Flying Squad, said that the theft had been carried out by an 'almost Ocean's 11 type team'. Mr Turner said: 'This was a particularly ambitious burglary to say the least and has affected so many victims. 'People's property has been taken, people's pensions, people's heirlooms which obviously can't be replaced by insurance firms. 'We may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost Ocean's 11 type team, but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves.' Destruction: Dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in London, where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor . Covered in dust and debris: Left, the forced door to the vault and, right, the mess left in the corridor . Inside knowledge: The gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door, pictured . Carefully planned: Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft (pictured) to climb down . Peter Kirkham, a former DCI with the Met Police who worked for the Flying Squad for five years in the mid-90s, said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the  heist was an inside job. Another former Flying Squad detective said: 'Everything you see indicates a very specialist knowledge both in what was inside the building and how to deal with it. Thursday, April 2: Workers from businesses in the building go home for long Easter weekend. Some have claimed the thieves were already hiding inside the building waiting to be locked in. Friday, April 3: Police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises, but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 00:21. No police car was sent. Traders have claimed a security guard attended the site but said he 'wasn't paid enough' to look inside the vaults. Saturday, April 4, Sunday April 5 and Monday, April 6: The exact time of the raid has not been confirmed, but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes, it is thought to have taken many hours. Tuesday, April 7: At 8am, workers return to the building and finding 'scenes of chaos'. They call the police, who attend. 'There is an expertise, combined with strength, patience, determination and, probably, an inside knowledge.' Releasing the scene images yesterday, Scotland Yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a 'significant amount of time'. The force said the team had recorded, packaged and recovered approximately 400 exhibits, including items for DNA profiling, fingerprints and other evidence. Specialist forensic photographers have also mapped out the crime scene and utilised digital techniques to record the inside of the premises, it said. Speaking tonight, Mr Turner appealed for members of the public who may have been in the Hatton Garden area during the theft and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward. Describing the drill that had been found at the scene as a 'specialised bit of equipment', he called for members of the criminal community who may have seen the gang in possession of it to get in touch. There are still six victims who have not been identified yet by police, Mr Turner said. 'I appeal to any of those victims who haven't been contacted by police to contact the incident room,' he added.

{"document": "Memories of drunken escapades may make us blush, but now a computer can use similar facial flushes to recognise people who have had one drink too many. Greek researchers created the algorithm, which determines a person’s state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face - especially the forehead and nose. And they say the technology could one day be installed in cars to spot drink drivers and stop them starting the ignition. Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers’ faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober (left) and drunken images (right) pixel-by-pixel (a single pixel is shown above the left eyebrow) Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers’ faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. Many people feel warmer and have hot flushes after drinking alcohol, caused by the drug affecting brain chemistry and the circulatory system. When alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream it increases heart rate and blood pressure and blood vessels open wide to allow for more rapid flow, which causes some people to flush. Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. In the study, the researchers found that the temperature of the forehead and to a lesser extent, the nose, is the best indication of a person’s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90% accuracy. While the alcohol got some volunteers more tipsy than others, they all had a blood alcohol content of at least 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood. This figure is the drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries – but slightly below the English and Welsh limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober and drunken images pixel-by-pixel. They found that the temperature of the forehead, and to a lesser extent the nose, is the best indication of a person’s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90 per cent accuracy. The scientists wrote in the study, published in the journal Forensic Journal International: ‘It was found that it was mainly the face forehead that changed thermal behaviour with alcohol consumption.' The algorithm worked even on faces that it hadn’t been trained on, and without comparing them to images of people when they were sober.

Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Just three hours behind the wheel at night can make motorists drive as badly as if they were drunk, scientists claim. Driver tiredness after a few hours has the same effect as being over the drink-driving limit, a 2011 study revealed. Even two hours of motorway driving in the dark can affect performance so severely it is the same as having a couple of drinks. It's estimated that one-fifth of all traffic accidents are due to sleepiness behind the wheel and one in three people admit to nodding off while driving at night. The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. It could perhaps work in tandem with other technology to stop a car from being able to be driven. Scientists in Germany are already working on a way to stop drink drivers getting behind the wheel by analysing their speechm for example. They announced in December they have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness by listening for vocal cues. Called the Alcohol Language Corpus, the database was made by researchers from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink, before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car, where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat. There are currently conversations from 162 German men and women in the publicly-available audio database. While the alcohol got some more tipsy than others, all the volunteers in the study had a blood alcohol content of 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood, which is the drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries. A stock image illustrating drink driving is shown . The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. Currently, breathalyzers (pictured) are used to measure alcohol content . From this, an algorithm capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns, was created by computer scientists at Queens College and Columbia University. They found they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent. Drunken speech hallmarks include stammering and stuttering. Voices also tend to rise in pitch and words begin to slur, they said. It is hoped that the software could be used alongside devices such as locks and immobilisers to make it impossible for people to drive when drunk – perhaps by asking them a few questions while analysing the driver’s voice. ‘The cars themselves could listen to the driver, detect that the potential driver is intoxicated, and prevent the car from starting,’ the researchers explained.", "summary": "Researchers from the University of Patras, in Greece created the algorithm .\nDetermines a person's state of intoxication by their facial temperature .\nAnalysing the forehead and nose gives an accuracy rate of 90 per cent .\nExperts say system could one day be used by the police, and even in cars ."}
{"document": "Rome (CNN)A destination for the destitute, Sicily is the \"promised land\" for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast. More than 10,000 people have arrived from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian Coast Guard. Stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between North Africa and Italy; boat people have been arriving on Italy's islands for more than a decade. But what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation, specifically those in Libya, because when Moammar Gadhafi was in control, he also controlled the flow of migrant ships. In 2008, the-then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi  signed an historic friendship agreement in which Italy promised to invest $5 billion in Libyan infrastructure and Gadhafi promised to close what he described as a \"spigot\" of migrants. During a three-day state visit to Italy in August 2010, he famously threatened to \"turn Europe black\" if Libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the European Union. After the agreement, Gadhafi  kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased. For a time, almost all migrant arrivals came from Tunisia, just 70 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because Italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to Tunisia, the flow eventually tapered off. And once a new Tunisian government was in place, after the Arab Spring, Italy signed an accord with Tunisia in which they promised to help patrol Tunisia's ports. But after Gadhafi was overthrown, the flow of migrants from Libya exploded again: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Rome told CNN that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the North Africa coast in 2011. In October 2013, after a tragic boat accident off the coast of Lampedusa in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died, trapped like sardines in their smugglers' boat as it sank, Italy decided it had to act. In November of 2013, the Italian Navy launched a €9M-a-month search-and-rescue program called Mare Nostrum, in which Italian naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants. In just one year, the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants, according to the Italian Navy. Due to budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean, the mission ended in October 2014. By the end of the year, more than 174,000 people had been rescued in Italy; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey, according to the IOM. In November last year, the European Union's border control, Frontex, started its own mission -- Triton -- with a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend them ships; a ship from Iceland, at the far north of the continent, is currently involved in Frontex's operations off southern Europe. When Italy ended Mare Nostrum, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned that some European governments were making \"keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards.\" \"This is a mistake, and precisely the wrong reaction for an era in which record numbers of people are fleeing wars,\" Guterres told a UNHCR policy meeting. \"Security and immigration management are concerns for any country, but policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage.\" Once migrants arrive in Italy, they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied, but Italy has been sanctioned by the European Union for not fingerprinting new arrivals. By law, Italy has to take care of the arrivals, but many have no intention of staying in the country, and few of the reception centers are gated, meaning migrants can come and go as they please. And with no physical border controls between Italy and other European countries, they can then disperse across the continent. Moutassem Yazbek, 27, an IT specialist who worked for six years in Dubai, arrived in Sicily in December on board a smuggler's boat. He told CNN he was never fingerprinted in Italy, and eventually made it to Germany where he is studying to learn the language and find work. He says the human trafficking network is a finely-oiled machine that fills a growing need. \"I would have done anything to get here,\" Yazbek said. \"It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear. Hard as that may be to believe, it is a better life.\"", "summary": "Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees risk the perilous journey across the Mediterranean every year .\nMany make the trip in dangerous boats owned by people smugglers; thousands have died along the way in recent years ."}
{"document": "(CNN)The presence of a harmful pesticide at a luxury villa in the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in the illness of a Delaware family, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. Paramedics were called last week to a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John after the family of four fell ill. They had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22, and were later hospitalized. The illness was reported to the EPA on March 20. \"Our preliminary results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying,\" said Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman. Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. \"It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\" Final test results were expected next week. The EPA is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. \"Pesticides can be very toxic, and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by EPA,\" said Judith A. Enck, a regional administrator for the EPA. \"The EPA is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere.\" Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said that the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. \"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" \"We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote. James Maron, an attorney who has been a spokesman for the family, has not responded to requests for comment. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as \"serious.\"", "summary": "Delaware family becomes ill at the Sirenusa resort in the U.S. Virgin Islands .\nPreliminary EPA results find methyl bromide was present in unit where family stayed .\nU.S. Justice Department has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter ."}

Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, 23, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of assisting an offender. Miss Watts was living with her father Darren Galsworthy, and her step-mother, Anjie, before she went missing from their home in St George, Bristol, on February 19. Her disappearance sparked a huge search. The teenager's remains were found 11 days later on March 2, at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city three miles away. The inquest at Flax Bourton in Somerset did not give a cause of the teenager's death. None of Miss Watts' family were present. Coroner's officer Deborah Neil told the court: 'Her death was confirmed on March 3 by a pathologist. She was identified by DNA. 'The brief circumstances are that Rebecca was reported to the police as a missing person. 'She was found later at an address in the Barton Hill area. She underwent a post-mortem examination at Flax Bourton and people have since been charged in connection with her murder.' Avon Coroner Maria Voisin adjourned the inquest until the outcome of criminal proceedings. She said the case would be reviewed in August. Scroll down for video . A funeral service for the teenager will take place on April 17 at St Ambrose Church in the Whitehall area of the city. Members of the public have raised almost £5,000 towards the cost of the funeral. A notice published in the Bristol Post said the church was reserved for family and close friends but the service would be relayed to mourners outside. Afterwards there will be a private family burial. Mr Galsworthy and his wife Anjie said in a statement: 'Becky was approaching the threshold of her adult life; she had so much to look forward to and love to share with all that were close and dear to her. Miss Watts' remains were discovered 11 days after her disappearance at a house in Barton Hill . 'We will miss her so much. 'All of us as a family, including those that knew Becky would like to express our most sincere gratitude to everyone that donated towards this day. 'Becky's death has touched the hearts of so many people; some from as far away as the other side of the world. 'We never expected that response but we are so very grateful for your thoughts, your prayers and your donations. Miss Watts had been living with her father in St George, Bristol, when she went missing . 'It is because of your kind support that we know the day will be a fitting tribute to a much loved daughter, grand-daughter, sister, niece and friend to so many people. 'We ask for your co-operation with regards to Becky's final laying to rest at the cemetery. 'We would like this to be very private and out of the public gaze, allowing us to say our final goodbye as we lay her to rest.' Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on March 26, along with five others charged in connection with the death. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of helping dispose of and conceal Becky's body parts. A plea hearing has been set for August 4, with a provisional trial date of October 5. All six defendants have been remanded in custody.

{"document": "Honesty is key in any relationship – but almost half of us lie to our partners about our finances, a study has revealed. Forty-five per cent of Britons have lied about their earnings, spending, bills or credit cards. And 41 per cent said they were in the dark about their partner's finances. Around one in five have lied to a partner about what they earn, with 10 per cent of those surveyed having understated their salary, four per cent having overstated it and another four per cent admitting to lying in both ways. The survey by financial guide Money Advice Service found 45 per cent of Brion have lied about their earnings, spending and credit cars, and 41 per cent of people surveyed din't know how much their partner earned . Of those who downplayed their wages, the main reason was to spare the feelings of a partner who earned less. However some said they lied to make sure their partner was with them for the right reasons – and not because of their bank account. The majority of insecure workers who exaggerated their salary to a partner because they didn't think they would stand a chance otherwise. Not wanting a partner to think they earned more came in second. The research by financial guide Money Advice Service also found that 24 per cent lied to their partners about what they spend on themselves. For women clothes were the biggest reason for lying, with 66 per cent fibbing about the cost of their wardrobe, while for men, technology purchases had caused 27 per cent to lie. The main reason for lying, the survey found, was to spare the feelings of a partner who earned less . Of the women who lied about how much they spend on themselves, two-thirds weren't honest with their partners about how much they spent on clothes and shoes. One in four men lied about technology purchases . Nick Hill, from Money Advice Service, says: 'For many couples, honesty is key to their relationship, but our research shows that many people hide the truth from their other half. 'Some people are comfortable telling their partner the truth about their finances, while others opt to hide their income or spending in order to avoid having a difficult conversation.

{"document": "The New Horizons spacecraft has taken its first colour image of Pluto and its largest moon Charon ahead of its arrival in three months. Taken from a distance of 71 million miles (115 million km), the blurry image doesn’t reveal a huge amount of detail - but it is a sign of things to come. As the spacecraft gets closer and closer, the images will continue to improve until it flies by on 14 July - humanity’s first ever visit to Pluto. Nearly there: After more than nine years, the New Horizons spacecraft is now just three months away from its historic encounter with Pluto. And now the spacecraft has taken its first colour image, shown, revealing the dwarf planet (the bigger blob) and its moon Charon . After a journey of more than nine years, Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft is now reaching the climax of its thrilling mission. It has traveled longer than any space mission in history to reach its primary target - with its pedometer measuring more than three billion miles (4.8 billion km). Its arrival at Pluto will be the last world in the ‘classical solar system’ to be explored. In July this year New Horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Pluto. It was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner . After passing the orbits of all the major planets from Earth to Neptune, New Horizons is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion-mile (4.8 billion km) journey. On 14 July 2015 the flyby of Pluto will begin. Using a suite of instruments, the spacecraft will map the surface of Pluto and its moon Charon to a resolution of 25 miles (40km) - far better than anything possible before. This will reveal the surface features of Pluto - which may include ice. As it flies past, it will also look back at the two bodies against the sun, to look for telltale signs of an atmosphere. Despite the long journey, New Horizons will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am GMT (06.49am EST) on 14 July and ending just after 2.15pm GMT (9.15am EST). After passing Pluto, New Horizons will flyby one or several Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), other bodies beyond the orbit of Pluto. The mission will officially end in 2026. Pluto was demoted from a ‘planet’ to a ‘dwarf planet’ in 2006 when other objects of a similar or greater size were found. But regardless, the mission is of huge importance for our understanding of how bodies form even at great distances from their host star. ‘New Horizons is one of the great explorations of our time,’ said New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver at the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. ‘There’s so much we don’t know, not just about Pluto, but other worlds like it. ‘We’re not rewriting textbooks with this historic mission - we’ll be writing them from scratch.’ The latest image of Pluto and Charon was captured by the Ralph camera on the spacecraft from a distance equivalent to the sun to Venus. At a relative speed of 30,000 mph (50,000km), New Horizons will cover that distance in just three months. The image shows Pluto with a sort of reddish colour and Charon - which is just over half the size of Pluto - considerably dimmer. Our best images of Pluto so far are mostly attempts from Hubble - but they are not much better than this photo. This makes the New Horizon mission particularly exciting, as it will reveal the surface of a world we know very little about. Not since humans first started sending spacecraft into the solar system has a comparable mission been seen. Our best images of Pluto so far come from the Hubble Space Telescope (shown is one of the images), so the arrival of New Horizons is hugely exciting for scientists, who have waited many years to catch a glimpse of this distant world and unravel some of its secrets . New Horizons (artist's illustration shown) was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner. Owing to the speed of New Horizons, the observations of Pluto will last just two hours . The flyby caps a five-decade-long era of reconnaissance that began with Venus and Mars in the early 1960s, and continued through first looks at Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s and Uranus and Neptune in the 1980s. Pluto is an extremely distant world, orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than Earth. It is about two thirds the size of our moon. With a surface temperature estimated to be -229°C (-380°F), the environment at Pluto is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface. Pluto's moons are also in the same frigid environment. The moon Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km). Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days. Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto - this is called tidal locking. Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side. ‘Scientific literature is filled with papers on the characteristics of Pluto and its moons from ground based and Earth orbiting space observations, but we’ve never studied Pluto up close and personal,’ said John Grunsfeld, Nasa Science Mission Directorate. ‘In an unprecedented flyby this July, our knowledge of what the Pluto systems is really like will expand exponentially and I have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries.’ Such is the mystery of Pluto that astronomers are not even sure what they will find on the surface. Pluto, the largest known body in the Kuiper Belt, is thought to have a nitrogen atmosphere and complex seasons. On its surface, it seems to have distinct markings, and it may have ice as well. The dwarf planet may even harbour an underground ocean. Among its five known moons, the largest - Charon - may itself sport an atmosphere or an interior ocean, and possibly even evidence of recent surface activity. Owing to the speed of New Horizons, the observations of Pluto will last just two hours. But it will collect a huge amount of data on Pluto and its moons, revealing unprecedented views - and with no other missions to Pluto in the pipeline, they will be our only images for a very, very long time. 'This is pure exploration; we’re going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes!” said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. 'New Horizons is flying to Pluto - the biggest, brightest and most complex of the dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt. 'This 21st century encounter is going to be an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of Voyager in the 1980s.' Not since Voyager 2 (illustrated left) flew past Neptune (right) in 1989 and started taking pictures has such a reconnaissance mission been attempted. New Horizons' mission represents the last of the worlds in the 'classical solar system' to be explored - and will be our sole visitor to Pluto for many, many years . Scientists still know very little about Pluto (illustrated left), its largest satellite Charon (right) and its other moons. Pluto, the largest known body in the Kuiper Belt, is thought to have a nitrogen atmosphere and complex seasons. On its surface, it seems to have distinct surface markings, and it may have ice as well . Pluto’s smaller moons also are likely to present scientific opportunities. When the New Horizons mission was first devised in 2001, it was a mission to just Pluto and Charon, before the four smaller moons were discovered. The spacecraft’s suite of seven science instruments - which includes cameras, spectrometers, and plasma and dust detectors - will map the geology of Pluto and Charon and map their surface compositions and temperatures. The spacecraft will also examine Pluto’s atmosphere, search for an atmosphere around Charon, study Pluto’s smaller satellites and look for rings and additional satellites around Pluto. Currently, even with New Horizons closer to Pluto than Earth is to the sun, the Pluto system resembles little more than bright dots in the distance. But teams operating the spacecraft are using these views to refine their knowledge of Pluto’s location, and skillfully navigate New Horizons toward a precise target point 7,750 miles (12,500 kilometers) from Pluto’s surface. That targeting is critical, since the computer commands that will orient the spacecraft and point its science instruments are based on knowing the exact time and location that New Horizons passes Pluto. This image, taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope, shows five moons orbiting the distant, icy dwarf planet Pluto. Styx (initially designated P5), is the innermost of the moons found by Hubble over the past seven years. This image was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 on 7 July 2012 . 'Our team has worked hard to get to this point, and we know we have just one shot to make this work,' said Alice Bowman, New Horizons mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. 'We’ve plotted out each step of the Pluto encounter, practiced it over and over, and we’re excited the \"real deal\" is finally here.' The spacecraft’s work doesn’t end with the July flyby. Because it gets one shot at its target, New Horizons is designed to gather as much data as it can, as quickly as it can, taking about 100 times as much data on close approach as it can send home before flying away. And although the spacecraft will send select, high-priority datasets home in the days just before and after close approach, the mission will continue returning the data stored in onboard memory for a full 16 months. Beyond Pluto, Nasa is also planning to study one or two Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) with New Horizons in the years after its historic primary mission.", "summary": "Nasa scientists in Maryland are preparing for historic mission on 14 July .\nThis is when New Horizons will arrive at Pluto after a journey of nine years .\nAnd it has now released its first colour image - from 71 million miles away .\nThe mission will be humanity's first ever visit to the dwarf planet ."}
{"document": "An agency is offering cash bonuses to Eastern European lorry drivers because they cannot find Britons to take up the jobs. Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, who already work in the UK, are being offered £100 for each driver they manage to lure into Britain from their home country. Employment agency Mainline is offering the incentive to any worker who refers a qualified Class A HGV driver to undertake work for four weeks. Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania who already work in the UK are being offered £100 by employment agency Mainline (pictured) to lure drivers from their home country to work in Britain . The company did try a recruitment drive to attract lorry drivers from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they say they were forced to look further afield when that scheme failed. This is despite there being 3,000 jobless residents in Swindon. Around 4.5 per cent are also unemployed across the south west. The vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that Britain’s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work, while acting as a magnet for foreigners. Debbie Jameson, from Mainline, said those who arrive from Eastern Europe are willing to work 'as many hours as they can' - something which she said British workers are less keen to do. She said: 'We don't just recruit drivers, we also recruit for permanent roles, call centre roles, industrial roles - everything. 'But it's mainly the skilled workers which we've been struggling to recruit. Numbers of HGV drivers have been dwindling over the years for various reasons.' Ms Jameson said one of the deterrents is the £2,000 outlay that is needed to get a lorry-driving licence. She said many still struggle to get jobs after that, because they are newly qualified drivers and do not have any experience. Mainline said it will offer to help workers from overseas find accommodation and settle into a new life in the UK. It will also provide them with courses so they have the chance to familiarise themselves with British roads, customs and culture. The company did try a recruitment drive to get lorry drivers to relocate from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they were forced to look further abroad when that scheme failed (file picture) She said: 'As numbers dwindled, we needed to use a bit of ingenuity. So we asked our workers to help us do our jobs by using their contacts in these countries to help fill these positions. 'We also offer it throughout the UK, and it used to be we'd have drivers from Scotland and Cornwall and Wales come to work in Swindon. We'd find them accommodation and help them settle in, but even that has dried up. 'In places like Romania, Bulgaria and Poland, the standard of living is far lower and wages are lower, and they can come over here to work. 'Even though the cost of living is quite high, the people who come to work are men, and they are here to make as much money as possible to support their families. 'It also means they are quite flexible and want to work as many hours as they can, which is something many people here don't want to do.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith previously claimed that the last Labour Government’s ‘open-door’ policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised Britons to work. Many employers have expressed concerns that they cannot get Britons to do manual jobs because they feel it is not the kind of work they want. Oppositely, in Eastern European countries, the average wage is around £7,000 - meaning workers can earn almost double that in the UK, even on a minimum wage. They would also have their wages topped up with tax credits - seen as a major attraction for EU migrants - and housing benefit. In November last year, the UK’s biggest sandwich maker said it was recruiting hundreds of workers from Eastern Europe for the same reason. Bosses from Greencore Group, which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda, flew to Hungary today in search of staff for its new factory. Allyson Russell, Greencore’s human resources director, said the company had tried to recruit in the UK, but that it was ‘not always the kind of work’ which people wanted to do. Last year, the Mail found British companies had placed almost 8,000 job adverts trying to recruit Romanian nurses, taxi drivers and hotel staff.", "summary": "Mainline, in Swindon, wants drivers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania .\nThey are offering £100 to each driver who can recruit from those countries .\nCompany said they tried scheme in the UK but few people came forward .\nCrisis will re-ignite claims that Britain’s welfare system has created generation unwilling to work ."}

{"document": "Stuart Dallas has come a long way since Mark Warburton plucked him from a glorified park and £70-a-week. The 23-year-old, who impressed for Northern Ireland in the week, scored two quite stunning goals as Brentford demolished Fulham 4-1 on Good Friday. They go into Monday's game against Nottingham Forest eyeing more than just a play-off spot. It was three years ago when Dallas was spotted by Warburton playing part-time on a mud bath for Crusaders back home. Stuart Dallas celebrates the second of his two excellent goals against Fulham on good Friday . Dallas has been a revelation this season as he helps Brentford push towards the Premier League . There were those who felt he wasn’t cut out for League One last season, but a three-month loan at Northampton has turned the winger into an integral figure as Brentford hunt Premier League promotion. ‘When I signed Stuart he was training once a week. He’s getting better and better - there’s more to come,’ Warburton said, before vouching for the maligned loan system. ‘Look at Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham. Get the loan right, where all three parties benefit. The 23-year-old starred for Northern Ireland last week, and his manager says it is down to his loan spell . Dallas spent three months at Northampton and has returned to prove himself back at Brentford . ‘Toumani Diagouraga went to Portsmouth [this season], played seven games and was made captain, came back and hasn’t looked back. Likewise with Stuart. They have to go out and get the right loan - it’s a big part of their development.’ Warburton has been doing the sums as Brentford face six games which could end-up being historic. ‘If a team puts a run together they’ll go clear with 90-odd points,’ he added. ‘If they do that, with the nature of the fixtures, teams will drop points. The average for the play-offs has been 72 for the last five years - I think you’ll need 75 minimum. If that’s the case we need two more wins.’", "summary": "Stuart Dallas, 23, was playing for Crusaders just three years ago .\nAfter a tough start to life at Brentford, he was loaned out to Northampton .\nSince returning to Brentford, he has become a star in promotion push ."}
{"document": "Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing (file picture) Men can judge how attractive a woman is by hearing her talk, according to a study. Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing. ‘People can make quite reliable guesses about women’s facial attractiveness on the basis of their voices,’ said study co-author Markus Koppensteiner, an anthropologist from the University of Vienna. He added: ‘Attractive voices may create an idea about what a woman will look like.’ Researchers photographed the faces and recorded the voices of 42 women with an average age of 24. They then asked a group of men – with an average age of mid 20s – to rate the women’s voices on attractiveness and another group of similar age to judge the attractiveness of their faces. Those rated highly for looks often scored well for sound too, with the study finding a ‘significant relationship between males’ ratings of female faces and voices. Findings suggest that women with an attractive face also tend to have an attractive voice’. The scientists also mapped the shape, size and layout of the women’s faces to work out which facial traits were considered to be more attractive both physically and vocally. They found women deemed the most attractive tended to have ‘lifted jawbones, less robust jaws and fuller lips’. The research could shed light on the visual and vocal appeal of radio broadcasters such as Fearne Cotton. Mr Koppensteiner added: ‘It could explain why women who have made it (on radio) also have attractive faces.’ Previous research has indicated women also pay close attention to men’s voices, preferring a deeper pitch because they associate it with a larger body size.

{"document": "Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta . McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club . Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.", "summary": "One Direction star Niall Horan will caddie for Rory McIlroy on Wednesday .\n1D released their debut album in 2011, same year McIlroy won first major .\nNiall is an honorary member at both Mullingar and Westmeath golf club .\nCaroline Wozniacki caddied for the Northern Ireland ace at 2014 Masters .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest news from the Masters 2015 ."}

{"document": "A former Florida State University student has filed a lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, claiming he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012. The lawsuit by Erica Kinsman, which seeks damages from the former Seminoles quarterback, was filed two weeks before the April 30 NFL draft. Winston could be selected as the first overall pick. Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013. He also was cleared by the university following a two-day student conduct hearing last year. The hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. Scroll down for video . Former Florida State University student Erica Kinsman filed a civil lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, saying he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012 . Former FSU quarterback and Heisman winner Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013 . But John Clune, a lawyer for Kinsman, said in a statement there are consequences for Winston's behavior 'and since others have refused to hold him accountable, our client will.' 'Erica hopes to show other survivors the strength and empowerment that can come from refusing to stay silent no matter what forces are against you,' Clune said. December 7, 2012 - Erica Kinsman files a police report claiming she was raped, though she can not identify the attacker. January 10, 2013 - She tells Tallahassee police she recognizes Winston as the assailant in a class and hears a professor call his name. November 13, 2013 - Prosecutor Willie Meggs is notified of the allegations and pushes police on an investigation, during which key witnesses are interviewed and evidence is sought. November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston. December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so. January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn. December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. He added: 'Jameis Winston in contrast has proven time and time again to be an entitled athlete who believes he can take what he wants. 'He took something here that he was not entitled to and he hurt someone. Kinsman told her alleged sexual assault story publicly in a documentary titled The Hunting Ground, which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus. Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's, according to the Daily Beast. She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told the pursuer he was her boyfriend. Kinsman claims that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, although she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment. She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her, penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop. The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room, when they told him to stop. He then took her into the bathroom, Kinsman said. There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her, 'You can leave now.' Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived. Kinsman's lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress . Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty . According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant. Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston. The lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress. Because the burden of proof is much lower in a civil lawsuit than in a criminal case, Kinsman could have a better chance of winning a jury verdict if it goes to trial. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said in a civil case the standard amounts to the 'greater weight' of the evidence, or 'merely tipping the scales in favor of the plaintiff.' In a criminal case, prosecutors must prove a person's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning jurors must be entirely convinced of guilt. Kinsman dropped out of FSU after the incident, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston . A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game . 'The scales have to be tipped all the way over to the side of the prosecution,' said Weinstein, who is not involved in the case. Weinstein also said that he thought Kinsman's chances of prevailing were good, based on the detailed allegations and multiple witness statements in the lawsuit. But that doesn't mean it will be easy. 'The defense will drag her character through the mud, so this is going to be an unpleasant process for her,' he said. 'However, Winston has a lot to lose, so I foresee a settlement and not a trial.' Kinsman has also filed a lawsuit against FSU's trustees, asserting that university officials had knowledge of her alleged sexual harassment and discrimination by the star quarterback and this created a hostile educational environment for her. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including reimbursement for tuition, damages for emotional pain and suffering and loss of past and present earning and earning capacity. Lawyers for the university's board of trustees contend the lawsuit should be dismissed because it does not show that FSU was responsible for her harassment, but they also maintain that they offered her assistance. Kinsman's story was featured in the documentary film The Hunting Ground, which is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations .", "summary": "Erica Kinsman filed lawsuit seeking damages from the former quarterback .\nShe claims he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012 .\nKinsman claims she met Winston while drinking in Tallahassee .\nShe says she took a shot offered by him at the bar in December 2012 .\nNext thing she recalled he was having sex with her in spite of pleas not to .\nWinston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013 .\nThe lawsuit was filed two weeks before the April 30 NFL draft, where Winston is a top prospect ."}

The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final . Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay . Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final . 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted.

Brussels will say that Google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services, which include YouTube and the Google+ social network.

Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in Europe's search engine market. The European Union will accuse Google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . But the ruling - the result of a five-year investigation into the American search giant – means Google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to Brussels.

And in a further blow to Google, the EU is also expected to probe Google's operating system for Android smartphones. The investigation will centre on whether Google imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps, such as YouTube. Google has previously rejected the allegations, and insisted that Android is an open platform that is distributed for free. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, will today serve Google with a formal charge sheet . After charges are issued, Google will have ten weeks to reply to Brussels, according to the Financial Times. They will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing. The investigation into Google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms. Google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website. However Europe initially accepted that deal, only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions. Vestager, Europe's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit Danish political drama series Borgen, took over the job in November and vowed to take Google on. Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the EU's decade-long battle with Microsoft, which ultimately cost the company £1.6 billion in fines. If Google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by Brussels, the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed £4 billion - about 10 per cent of Google's most recent annual revenue. The move will stop short of previous threats that the EU executive could consider breaking up Google to separate its business from the search engine. Google has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years. But the latest move by the EU marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing. The search engine is far more dominant in Europe than it is in the United States – where rivals like Microsoft's Bing enjoy a share of the market. And there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of Google from many countries in the EU. In fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals. More than two dozen European organisations have filed antitrust complaints against Google. Many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in Germany. They have previously called on the European regulator to force the American search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps, shopping and travel services. And in France, lawyers have this week called on Google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites – but Google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam. Google and the EU commission declined to comment last night. Vestager's department is also looking into the tax affairs of Amazon, Starbucks, Fiat and Apple. In a recent Sunday Times article she said big companies should pay more as they 'are part of our society.'

{"document": "Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer . Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football . Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships . Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October . 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’", "summary": "Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans .\nBerahino is expected to be involved with England at under 21 Euros .\n21-year-old has made no secret of desire to play in Champions League .\nBerahino shares same agent as Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling ."}
{"document": "(CNN)A former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that survived a Japanese torpedo strike and was a massive guinea pig for two atomic bomb blasts looks remarkably intact at the bottom of the Pacific, according to federal researchers who surveyed the wreck last month with an underwater drone. The USS Independence was scuttled in January 1951 during weapons testing near California's Farallon Islands. Although its location was confirmed by a survey in 2009, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration went looking for it again in March as part of a project to map about 300 wrecks that lie in and around the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. \"After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,\" mission leader James Delgado, the maritime heritage director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, said in a statement. Indeed, sonar images show what looks to be an airplane on one of the elevators that took planes from the Independence's hangar deck to its flight deck. The ship sits upright with a slight list to starboard, according to NOAA. NOAA's survey of the 623-foot-long, 11,000-ton carrier was conducted by the Echo Ranger, an 18.5-foot-long autonomous underwater vehicle provided by the Boeing Co. The Echo Ranger traveled 30 miles from its base in Half Moon Bay, California, and hovered 150 above the carrier, which lies 2,600 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The drone used a three-dimensional sonar system provided by Coda Octopus to get images that showed how well the warship has weathered 64 years in the deep. \"This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the 'greatest generation' that sent not only this ship, but their loved ones to war,\" Delgado said in the statement. In its 20 years in the Navy, the ship played a role in some of the most important events of World War II, earning eight battle stars in the process, and the dawn of the nuclear age. Independence was seriously damaged by Japanese torpedo planes during the Battle of Tarawa in late 1943. The ship returned to California for repairs and made it back across the Pacific by July 1944 to participate in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and the sinking of one of the Japanese Imperial Navy's biggest warships, the battleship Musashi. Later, in the Battle of Cape Engano, planes from the Independence were involved in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers. After the war, Independence became part of a fleet used to measure the effects of atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on July 1, 1946. It sat just 560 yards from ground zero in the first test, a 23-kiloton air blast of a fission bomb similar to the one used over Nagasaki, Japan, a year earlier, according to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Twenty-four days later, Independence was 1,390 yards from the center of a second atomic blast -- also a 23-kiloton device but an underwater detonation. The ship was later brought back to California for nuclear decontamination before being sunk during the weapons training in 1951. NOAA said no signs of radioactive contamination were noted during the survey of the sunken carrier last month. The agency has no plans for further missions to the ship, according to the NOAA statement.", "summary": "USS Independence was sunk in 1951 after weapons tests .\nCarrier was close-in guinea pig to two atomic bomb tests .\nAgency: Ship looks remarkably intact 2,600 feet below surface of the Pacific Ocean ."}

{"document": "There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington today, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said. Scroll down for video . During a talk today, Nasa announced that humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) at a Washington panel discussion . 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places. Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep. Scientists using the Hubble recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter's moon Ganymede (pictured) has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice . The same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year. 'We think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex,' Stofan said. Nasa associate administrator John Grunsfeld said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond Earth may take. In their hunt for alien life, astronomers have so far focused on looking for Earth-like planets around smaller, cooler suns. But these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star. Now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars, and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day-night cycle similar to Earth – increasing the chance of finding alien life. Planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to Earth's than previously expected,' said Jérémy Leconte, a postdoctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. 'If we are correct, there is no permanent, cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet,' he said. 'Whether this new understanding of exoplanets' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question.' 'Once we get beyond Mars, which formed from the same stuff as Earth, the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low,' he said. 'I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation [away] on a planet around a nearby star. Scientists using the Hubble recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's satellite Enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface in contact with mineral-rich rock. This, according to Nasa, means they may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it. 'The science community is making enormous progress,' said Green. 'And I've told my team I'm planning to be the director of planetary science when we discover life in the solar system. At the same conference last year, Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden made a more conservative estimate. He claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. Nasa next Mars rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to Earth for analysis. New Horizons took this image of the icy moon Europa rising above Jupiter's cloud tops. The space agency is planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022, to find out whether the moon is habitable . Nasa also hopes to land astronauts on Mars in the 2030s, which Stofan says is crucial key to the search for Mars life. 'I'm a field geologist; I go out and break open rocks and look for fossils,' Stofan said. 'Those are hard to find. 'So I have a bias that it's eventually going to take humans on the surface of Mars — field geologists, astrobiologists, chemists — actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to Earth for all the scientists to argue about.' The space agency is also planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022. It hopes to find out whether the icy moon is habitable. Meanwhile, the agency's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will launch in 2018 to scope out the atmospheres of nearby 'super-Earth' alien planets.", "summary": "The comment was made today by Ellen Stofan, chief Nasa scientist .\n'It's definitely not an if, it's a when,' added Nasa's Jeffery Newmark .\nBut the likelihood that life is similar to that on Earth is low, they said .\nSigns of water have been found on some of Jupiter and Saturn's moons ."}
{"document": "Moscow (CNN)Never mind. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. \"We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,\" Peskov said. \"The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.\" The visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing.  And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own.

{"document": "A former bomb disposal expert has won his battle with the bulge after shedding half his bodyweight after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Steve Tempest-Mitchell, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, lost a whopping 16st after the surgery 14 months ago, which caused his stomach to shrink to the size of a tennis ball. The 56-year-old said he decided to go through with the operation after hitting 32st and struggling to control his Type 2 diabetes. Scroll down for video . Slim and trim: Steve Tempest-Mitchell says he has a new lease of life after slimming down from 32st to 16st . 'It was a case of going in for the surgery and hoping to come out the other side,' said the father-of-three. This was a life changing and life threatening decision for me to make. 'At 32st, it was not an easy decision as I had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously . 'It had got to a point where something had to be done because I was slowly killing myself. I was just waiting for something awful to happen and even needed psychiatric help.' Although he never indulged in binge-eating, Mr Tempest-Mitchell says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day. But the former bomb disposal expert hadn't always been big and he says that growing up, he lived an active lifestyle, regularly playing rugby and competing in wrestling. Flashback: Mr Tempest-Mitchell said he was almost a recluse when he was at his biggest (above) As he got older, he began to struggle with his weight thanks to a lifestyle of long-haul flights, business meetings and boozy evenings spent entertaining clients. Mr Tempest-Mitchell also had to contend with some highly stressful situations while working as a bomb disposal expert between 1996 and 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was employed as a contractor with the Ministry of Defence. Using high-pressure water technology, he would set about the grim task of defusing bombs. 'It was a very stressful situation,' he explains. 'Not only have you got to handle the situation of defusing the threat of the bomb but you are in dangerous territory as well under guard from soldiers. Helping hand: The former bomb disposal expert said he needed to be pushed in a wheelchair to board a plane . 'We were very lucky as one of the bases we were stationed at was attacked by a rocket launcher just weeks after we left.' Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who is now a business development manager at a demolition and asbestos removal firm, said as the years went by, his weight crept up. 'I had a very active lifestyle before my work and life balance was disrupted and I began to not have time to eat right,' he said. 'I was never one of those people who would eat massive amounts of food where you are stunned by the amount but I did have small portions regularly. 'Ever since I was a child, I always drank coke. At one point, I was having between six to eight cans a day. I have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks. I don't mind if I never have one again.' The father-of-three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem . As a result of the weight gain, Mr Tempest-Mitchell almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out. His weight issues even affected his working life, as well as his confidence and self esteem. 'I was forced to park the car as close as possible to wherever I was going, if I couldn't, I'd have to turn back and go home,' he recalls. 'I was almost becoming a recluse as I was unable to visit sites for my work so instead worked from home. I was becoming a burden on my family, especially when we tried to go on holiday. I had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair.' Fed up, he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather. Both of his daughters, aged 26 and 36, were expecting babies. 'My one daughter came to see me while I was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant,' said Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who also has a 34-year-old son. Although he never indulged in eating too many snacks, he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day . 'I was so thrilled as I knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up.' As well as losing more than a stone a month, he has also seen his waist shrink from 66 inches to 42 inches and his chest go down from 66 inches to 48 inches.

{"document": "Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects – including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.'", "summary": "Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests .\nTests pinpoint genetic 'markers' in tumour and determine aggressiveness .\nThey are available privately for £2,500 and may be rolled out soon on NHS .\nWomen told within days whether they have a high  risk of disease returning ."}
{"document": "Fran Kirby staked an impressive claim for a World Cup starting role with England Women as she created the first goal and scored a brilliant second in a 2-1 win over China. England began in thrilling style, with Kirby fashioning the opener for strike partner Jodie Taylor after just a minute of play. Reading striker Kirby then fired home the second goal of her short international career - this was her eighth cap - to put the home side in apparently full control at Manchester City's Academy Stadium. Jodie Taylor celebrates following her opening minute strike against China in Manchester . But as 5,665 watched on, England struggled to build on their early assault on the China goal. Wang Shanshan cut China's arrears after shaky defending, and might have had an equaliser in the second half but mis-kicked as England feared the worst. Kirby, a 21-year-old playing in the second division of the Women's Super League, was impressive throughout, a nimble-footed presence who China struggled to deal with. She was player of the match when England played the United States in February, and was again arguably a class apart, although this time midfielder Jill Scott took the champagne. Fran Kirby (left) is congratulated by her England team-mates after she netted the second goal for his side . China were caught cold when Kirby dribbled the ball down the left and curved a tremendous ball with the outside of her right boot to Taylor, who fired past Zhang Yue for the early opener. The architect turned predator to put the hosts 2-0 in front in the 10th minute, meeting a right-wing cross from Jordan Nobbs with a clever touch on her chest that took out her marker before smashing home from 10 yards. Just two minutes later the lively Reading striker, with 10 goals in her last three club matches, forced Zhang to push away a 20-yard drive. Jade Moore hit the left post after a hopeless kick out from Zhang, and England were rampant. Kirby was in imperious form during the first half as she created the first goal and scored the second . That changed once China cut the deficit after 16 minutes, with hesitant defending at a corner allowing Wang to head past Siobhan Chamberlain from close range. Chamberlain had to save well to turn away a free-kick from Li Dongna before the break, with defensive insecurities becoming a worrying feature of England's game. This was England's last home game before Mark Sampson's squad head to Canada in May, ahead of a World Cup campaign that begins against France in Moncton on June 9. England made their first change after 61 minutes as Toni Duggan, on her home ground, replaced Jade Moore. Shanshan Wang races away to celebrate after she pulled a goal back for China in the 16th minute . Kirby almost created a third goal but her cutback after a run down the left went just astray of white shirts. Alex Greenwood prodded a corner just over the China bar, and Duggan headed at Zhang, as chances began to arrive more frequently for England. Kirby departed, with the experienced Eni Aluko taking her place, Wang missed her sitter, and England clung on, the world's sixth-ranked team fending off a side rated 16th globally by FIFA.

{"document": "The sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series has been shrouded in such secrecy the novel is being written on computers with no internet connection to avoid any leaks. The Girl In The Spider's Web, published worldwide on August 27, will be the fourth installment in the best-selling Millennium crime trilogy by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. The book was completed in November by David Lagercrantz based on a plot outline left by Larsson before he died of a heart attack in 2004 aged 50. Mr Lagercrantz, known for co-authoring Swedish football star Zlatan Ibrahimovic's autobiography, said the publishers have gone to extreme lengths to keep the novel under wraps. However, Norstedts did yesterday reveal that it kicks off with an artificial intelligence intrigue involving a U.S. spy agency. Under wraps: The sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series by Steig Larsson (left) entitled The Girl In The Spider's Web (right) has been shrouded in such secrecy it is being written on computers with no internet . The 500-page sequel takes up the story of tattooed computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, whom she helps solve a murder mystery  in the first book in the series. Mr Lagercrantz said he, the editors and translators were subject to similar kinds of espionage-style secrecy, reportedly working on computers disconnected from the Internet to avoid leaks. He told the Dagens Nyheter daily: 'If you write about Lisbeth Salander its easy to get a little paranoid. 'You realise what opportunities there are to hack computers. 'It was a little awkward. 'Every time I needed to Google I had to do it on another computer. And we used code words - like our own little spy world.' Its British publisher, MacLehose Press, which has unveiled the front cover showing Salander with her dragon tattoo and wearing punk trousers, said they have given strict instructions to follow suit. Taking up the mantle: The book was completed in November by David Lagercrantz (above) based on a plot outline left by Larsson before he died of a heart attack in 2004 aged 50 . Christopher MacLehose told The Guardian: 'The Swedish original publishers Norstedts have put everyone on notice that no particle of this book can be shared with anybody. 'There'll be no review copies in any language before it's launched on 27 August... nobody will be in a position to beat the ring of steel around this book.' The novel is called Det som inte dödar oss in the original Swedish - or What Doesn’t Kill You - but given a different title for the English version. It is being translated into 38 languages. Setting the scene, Norstedts publishing house wrote on its website: 'One night professor Frans Balder, a leading authority within AI (artificial intelligence) research, calls up Blomkvist. 'Balder says he has world-shattering information on U.S. intelligence services... had contact with a female super hacker, who bears a certain resemblance to a person Blomkvist knows well.' Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have been 'furious' about the release of The Girl In The Spider's Web, the fourth book in the Millennium series which began with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo . Until now the publishers had remained tight-lipped about the plot, only saying that it would continue the story of the trilogy's heroine, which has sold more than 75 million copies worldwide. The book has been given the blessing of Mr Larsson's estate, but not from his long-term partner. Eva Gabrielsson said last month that the journalist, who co-founded the anti-racism magazine Expo in Sweden, 'would be furious' if he knew someone else was writing his story. Gabrielsson, who lost a bitter battle with the late author's family to manage his work, added that Lagercrantz was 'a totally idiotic choice' as he lacked Larsson's left-wing activist background. Norstedts have compared the planned release on August 27 of the book in at least 35 countries to the global splash made by Dan Brown's sequels to the 2003 'Da Vinci Code'. At the time of his death, Larsson reportedly had plans to write at least another seven novels.", "summary": "The Girl In The Spider's Web is fourth installment in Stieg Larsson's series .\nWritten and translated on computers with no web connection to avoid leaks .\nPlot kicks off with artificial intelligence intrigue involving a U.S. spy agency ."}
{"document": "Even in a world of flash cars and designer clothes, many will be familiar with the saying: 'Money doesn't buy happiness.' It turns out, there are things that you can do to make you feel slightly happier everyday. The best part? According to author of Happier People Healthier Planet, Dr Teresa Belton, they're all completely free. Dr Teresa Belton insists that there are many simple things - such as inviting a lonely person out to tea - that we can do on a daily basis to increase happiness, and they are all free . Researcher and education expert at the University of East Anglia, Dr Teresa Belton, believes that people living modestly tend to find more satisfaction in their lives. Simple activities such as inviting someone out for a cup of tea, singing in a community choir and practicing good posture can all improve general wellbeing. This is because they are all activities that generate a sense of belonging, and help the person adopt confident habits. Author Belton has insisted that practices as small as going on walks can be calming and restorative . The 62-year-old believes simple acts such as straightening posture (left) and joining a community choir (right) can increase happiness levels over time . Firstly the doctor emphasises that it is important to prioritise 'wellbeing' over happiness. Belton says: 'Wellbeing is a continuing state, while happiness can come and go. Wellbeing means that we both feel good and function well.' Her book, Happier People Healthier Planet, supports the belief that while many strive for material things that may generate temporary happiness, it is not sustainable way to be. Belton insists that it's actually non-material things that support our wellbeing, like good relationships and a sense of belonging. List five things for which you are grateful: Whether they are big or small things, Belton recommends doing this for ten weeks can have a big impact on wellbeing . Among her simply everyday tips to feeling happier right away - see below - she highlights seemingly trivial activities such as standing up straight and smiling, and even hanging washing up outdoors. The doctor and author also highlights that there are ways you can invest in happiness and wellbeing for the long run. Practices include regularly making lists of things for which you are grateful. In fact, studies have shown that doing this for a period of ten weeks can have a real lasting affect on wellbeing. Other practices include mindful meditation and taking up voluntary work. Declutter:  Give stuff away, donate possessions to charity or pass them on to someone who could use them. This can relieve stress and create a sense of lightness and unburdening. A less cluttered bedroom can also bring the added bonus of better sleep. Hang washing up outdoors: Getting some fresh air and creating an orderly line of washing will give you a relaxing break and a reason to get outside in the garden. Invite a lonely person to tea: Or offer to help your neighbour with their garden, leaking pipe, shopping, etc. Feeling needed and having a sense of belonging to a community are important factors for a sense of wellbeing. Go for a walk: Time spent in green surroundings has shown time and time again to be calming and restorative. Even a green view is beneficial, so try and buy some indoor plants too: geraniums for a window sill, ivy for a dark corner, and herbs for the kitchen. Stand up straight, and smile: The way we hold ourselves and our facial expression affects the way we feel. Adopt a confident posture and you will feel more confident; look calmly on the world and it will seem a friendlier place. Visit an empty beach or hilltop: Being a tiny part of an immense landscape can reassuringly put worries into perspective. Get moving: Physical activity gets us out of our heads and generates endorphins, the hormone which makes us feel good; dig the garden, cycle, walk, dance, make pastry, or even mow the lawn. Appreciate the little things: From a spider spinning a web, to a bird singing: these are just a few of the endless everyday details which we often overlook or take for granted, yet which can delight us if we let them. List five things for which you are grateful: Whether they are big or small. Research has shown that doing this every week for ten weeks can result in lasting increases in wellbeing, as it gets us into the habit of seeing our life through a positive lens. Join a community choir: Singing regularly with other people is rewarding not only because of the pleasure derived from the music itself, but also because it is sociable and it demands effort, commitment and attention. Take up regular voluntary work: Social connectedness, as well as freely giving your time, attention and energy, and making a positive difference  all contributes to our own satisfaction with life. Get stuck in: Active engagement is a big aspect of personal wellbeing. If you really enjoy your chosen activity, you will lose yourself in it and experience a wonderful sense of 'flow'. Think about your place in the scheme of things: Having a sense of meaning or purpose in life, whether it is religious, political, social, artistic or any other framework, is known to be important for wellbeing. Take up mindfulness meditation: Regular practice of mindfulness meditation decreases anxiety and increases calmness, working memory and flexibility of thought. Take charge: Start a petition, write to your MP or local councillor, or join a campaign about an issue that concerns you. We are happier if we are proactive and feel like we have a say in things. Value relationships over material objects: Levels of wellbeing have not risen in the UK since the 1970's despite an increase in affluence. It's relationships and social networks that contribute towards enduring happiness.", "summary": "Teresa Belton, 62, is author of Happier People Healthier Planet .\nBased in Norwich, she believes that people living modestly are happier .\nSimple acts create sense of belonging and put things into perspective ."}

She told the court she had drank a bottle of wine while her son was away on a trip, adding: 'I was lonely... I got myself in a state' When police finally managed to breathalyse her, she was three times the limit.

She told the court: 'Police received information about a black Lexus driving all over the road and nearly hitting cars. 'The officer turned on the emergency lights but the car made no attempt to stop. He drove diagonally to block her way. 'She crept the car forward like she was trying to drive off.

Adrian Long, chairman of the bench, said: 'We've listened to what you and Mr Isherwood said but it was a very high reading and you have a previous conviction.' She was given an 18-month community order, alcohol rehabilitation programme, 120 hours unpaid work and was banned from driving for four years.

The leap sent the family and other patrons running, but Cave said when he looked back, \"it wasn't as bad as we thought it was.\" Dan Cassidy with the Henry Doorly Zoo said he's been surprised by the attention since he considered the whole thing a \"nonevent.\" The group of male gorillas is known to have occasional skirmishes. \"They show how tough they are by pounding on the wall and the windows,\" Cassidy said.

{"document": "Only after the fourth goal had been scored, only after this derby demolition had been completed, did Louis van Gaal turn to the most expensive player in English football and the player who commands the highest wages. Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were little more than fresh legs here on Sunday, and any success Van Gaal has enjoyed in his first season at Old Trafford needs to be measured against the difficulties two phenomenally talented players have endured. But it also a measure of the qualities the Dutchman possesses that players with only a fraction of their ability are not just keeping them out of the side, but are performing as well as this. Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were left on the bench by Louis van Gaal on Sunday . Argentine £60m man Di Maria came on for Juan Mata in the 81st minute at Old Trafford . Falcao replaced Belgian Marouane Fellaini with seven minutes to play in the win over Manchester City . A sixth successive Premier League victory that cements United in third place owes much to the revival of Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata and the progress being made by Chris Smalling and Phil Jones. David Moyes once said Smalling and Jones were good enough to become England’s central defensive pairing and Roy Hodgson, a spectator here on Sunday, is sure to be encouraged by their rate of development. In Young, Fellaini and Mata the transformation has been most startling, however, and credit has to go to Van Gaal for the way he has managed three players who were so central to the downfall of Moyes 12 months ago. In fairness to Fellaini, and indeed Moyes, the Belgian just needed time to make the transition from Everton to United. In fairness to Mata, he probably needed time, too, after being ejected from Chelsea by Jose Mourinho. Ashley Young celebrates after bringing Manchester United level having earlier trailed . But Young is a triumph for the style of leadership Van Gaal has long been recognised for: his ability to work with players on a personal basis as well as part of a collective. Even Van Gaal’s critics recognise the skills that also made him a fine schoolteacher when he was supplementing his income as a poorly paid player in Holland with a career in education. He is clearly very good at restoring confidence and inspiring an individual, with Young finally looking like the player Martin O’Neill used to admire so much. Young, one of five Englishmen in United’s outfield 10, was the outstanding player in this hugely entertaining contest, scoring the equaliser that quickly cancelled out Sergio Aguero’s opener, as well as providing the assists for Fellaini and Smalling, but more to the point, responding most effectively to what, presumably, were his manager’s instructions. Fellaini headed in at the far post to give Manchester United the lead and continue his fine recent form . Mata slots under Joe Hart to extend Manchester United's lead to 3-1 early in the second half . Van Gaal would have seen how vulnerable City were to the aerial threat posed by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Monday and it was Young who delivered the crosses that enabled United’s tallest players to punish them again, on both occasions with headers. Exactly why the issue had not been addressed by Manuel Pellegrini is anybody’s guess. But if this game highlighted the skills of Van Gaal, it also illustrated where City’s beleaguered manager has fallen short this season. While United are in the ascendancy, Pellegrini has overseen a period of decline for a stuttering City side. While United are now celebrating the renaissance of players like Young, Pellegrini faces the question of what on earth has happened to a side who were so superior to United a year ago. Chris Smalling headed in a free-kick to score Manchester United's fourth goal in the derby . England manager Roy Hodgson watched the Manchester derby from the stands at Old Trafford . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of his last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. It was a 3-0 win at Old Trafford that effectively finished Moyes at United, with the eventual champions moving 15 points clear of their neighbours that day with two games to spare. But this game was a microcosm of City’s season: a decent start, marked by that first Aguero goal, and then a period of steady, draining decline. Since the turn of the year City have collected just 18 points from 13 games. Compare that to United, who have taken 29 from the same number of matches. Pellegrini was honest enough to admit that they have thrown away their title defence with the ‘garbage’ but the real garbage is on the pitch, in the form of some truly inept performances. Not least away from home. If Pellegrini had a desire to ‘continue being noisy’ and extend a period of dominance over their neighbours to a fifth league meeting, the evidence on Sunday would suggest it was not shared by his players. They were a poor imitation of the side that so impressed here last year. Nothing like the champions of England. Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Manuel Pellegrini after the final whistle . Manchester United boss Van Gaal thanked supporters for their patience after Sunday's victory . Manchester City boss Pellegrini has come under increasing pressure after a dismal second half of the season . Compared to Chelsea, United are some way short of the best in England too and both clubs will need to invest heavily again this summer to close that gap. But this morning United and City appear to be travelling in opposite directions, one on the rise and the other entering another period of upheaval. Vincent Kompany blames financial fair play but overlooks the fact that Pellegrini has actually spent more than £75million since last summer. Just as he ignores that the problem is closer to home; that he is chief among players operating on restricted power. At Old Trafford the drop in standards at City was obvious to all, and probably explained why the atmosphere was electric. United’s supporters are enjoying seeing City suffer as much as they are now beginning to appreciate the leadership of Van Gaal. His management has taken on an almost magical quality. Judging by the fact that he can keep his two most expensive players on the bench for 80-odd minutes and nobody even notices.", "summary": "Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford .\nWin moved United four points clear of City in third place in the table .\nLouis van Gaal has left Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on bench .\nAshley Young, Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini have all been revived .\nChris Smalling and Phil Jones are showing progress at the back ."}
{"document": "A new Ebola jab is being given to people living in the West African countries most badly hit by the virus after human trials in unaffected countries proved successful. Scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after 'highly promising results' in the first 138 healthy adults who were vaccinated with various doses. The vaccine, developed in Canada, is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the Ebola virus. Scroll down for video . A new Ebola jab is being given to people living in the West African countries most badly hit by the virus. Pictured: a man washes his hands at a checkpoint in Sierra Leone's during the recent country-wide lockdown to combat the virus . When administered, it induces an immune response against the Ebola virus. The researchers, whose findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said one jab protects against a disease which has killed more than more than 10,460 people in a year across six countries including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali. Dr Michael Ramharter, of the Medical Research Unit at Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Lambarene, Gabon, said the Ebola antigen is inserted into the vaccine as a Trojan horse to get the body to develop an immune response against the virus. He said: 'An Ebola glycoprotein from the Ebola strain in Zaire is being inserted into the VSV live vaccine. While VSV only causes mild symptoms in humans, the protein acts as an Ebola antigen and triggers the formation of antibodies against the disease in the immune system.' Dr Ramharter said these antibodies hide, almost like a 'Trojan horse', in the body in order to successfully fight the Ebola virus if the individual becomes infected. Scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after 'highly promising results' He added: 'Just one vaccine has conferred one hundred per cent protection against Ebola in the initial trials on primates.' Dr Ramharter said the first phase I clinical trial is now complete. He said: 'The vaccine response is very reliable, the vaccine itself is safe and its tolerability is acceptable.' The most significant side effect was found to be temporary joint pain and inflammation reported among a small group of test subjects, particularly in the European centres. In the phase II studies that are now beginning, the vaccine will be used in patients living in the areas currently most badly affected by Ebola, especially Guinea and Sierra Leone, but also in Liberia. The first case of Ebola was reported in West Africa around 15 months ago. According to estimates, around 25,000 people have been infected by the virus - and more than 10,000 of them having died since as a result. The race is on to find ways to prevent and cure the Ebola virus as there are no proven treatments or vaccines to prevent individuals becoming infected. But progress is now being made on an unprecedented scale with trials which would normally take years and decades being fast tracked on a timescale of weeks and months. The aim is to use the lowest dose of vaccine possible that provides protection. Vaccines train the immune systems of healthy people to fight off any future infection.

Photographs taken of her vehicle show her sandals remained resting in the footwell of the driver's seat, while the exterior of the white vehicle was left stained with her blood. While investigators declined to speculate on a motive for the killing, friends and colleagues immediately described her death as a targeted assassination in Pakistan - a country with a nascent democracy where the military and intelligence services still hold tremendous sway. Scroll down for video . Assassinated women's rights activist Sabeen Mahmud's sandals remain in the footwell of her car, where she was gunned down on Friday night . A Pakistani cameraman films her car hours after she was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle . Pakistani police officers examine the damaged car, who was killed as she returned to her home in Karachi . The gunmen shot both Mahmud and her mother, Mehnaz Mahmud, as they stopped at a traffic light Friday night in an upscale Karachi neighborhood, senior police officer Zafar Iqbal said. Later, journalists saw their car at a nearby police station, the front driver's side window smashed out and the pair of sandals on the floorboard with broken glass all around them. Blood stained the car's white body. 'Two men riding a motorcycle opened fire on the car,' Iqbal said, adding that Mehmud 'died on her way to the hospital. Her mother was also wounded.' Alia Chughtai, a close friend of Mahmud, said that she was driving at the time of attack and her mother was sitting next to her. She added that Mahmud's driver, who escaped unharmed, was sitting in the back seat at the time of the attack but she was unsure why the driver wasn't driving the car. Mr Iqbal and other police officials declined to offer a motive for the slaying. However, earlier that night Mahmud hosted an event at her organization called The Second Floor to discuss human rights in Baluchistan, an impoverished but resource-rich southwestern province bordering Iran. Thousands of people have disappeared from the province in recent years amid a government crackdown on nationalists and insurgent groups there. Activists blame the government for the disappearances, something authorities deny. Qadeer Baluch, an activist who last year led a nearly 3,000-kilometer (1,900-mile) protest march across Pakistan to demand justice for the missing in Baluchistan, attended the event. He hinted that the government could be involved in Mahmud's slaying. People carry the casket Sabeen Mahmud, who was killed by two unknown gunmen on a motorcycle . 'Everybody knows who killed her and why,' Baluch told Pakistan's The Nation newspaper, without elaborating. 'The programme organisers were already receiving threats. It is very difficult to talk about Baluchistan in Pakistan.' Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned Mahmud's killing and ordered an investigation into the attack. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad also condemned Mahmud's slaying and offered condolences to her loved ones. Mahmud was 'a courageous voice of the Pakistani people and her death represents a great loss,' it said. She was a well-known activist who also ran a small tech company, hosted poetry readings, computer workshops and other events at The Second Floor. She continued to live in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port city, even while acknowledging the danger from insurgent groups and criminals operating there. 'Fear is just a line in your head,' Mahmud told Wired magazine in 2013. 'You can choose what side of that line you want to be on.'

Mr Hawley, who was in New York attending a business conference at the time, collapsed after returning from a swim. 'He did go for a big swim in the morning, he trains very hard,' David said of his brother, who he described as a 'bit of a fitness fanatic' and was known to lead a healthy and active lifestyle. 'I think his body clock was round the wrong way and it just got everything round the wrong way and he's over done it.' Mr Hawley was a father to four children, Lucia, 16, Hamish, 14, James, 12, and Sybella, eight, all of whom he shared with Nicole Kidman's sister Antonia before their 2007 split. The children are reportedly set to join the family in Sydney as they rally around David's second wife Prue Fisher, who he married in Palm Beach in 2011.

The world No 1 - now 103 places above Woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the Masters next week and claim his first green jacket, thus completing a career Grand Slam. Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him.

McIlroy played golf from a young age and always admired Woods as he grew up in Northern Ireland . McIlroy grew up watching Woods and is now on his way to emulating his hero . McIlroy revealed recently that he sent Tiger a letter saying he was 'coming to get' him . Rory's rise from child prodigy to the world's best - along with his fascination with Woods' stellar career - has now been beautifully told in a new two-minute video created by their sponsors Nike. Entitled 'Ripple', the clip features a number of young actors portraying McIlroy as a kid and into his teenage years - from hitting plastic balls around his parents' living room, to practising relentlessly in his hometown of Holywood, Northern Ireland. A common theme runs through the video as McIlroy and his father keep a close eye on Tiger's progress on both the PGA Tour and at the major championships. Speaking about 'Ripple', McIlroy said: 'As a kid, I looked up to Tiger. When I first saw him on TV, I remember being completely enamored by the energy he brought to the sport. His will to win. His determination. His fight.' McIlroy and Woods will line up at Augusta for the Masters this week but in contrasting form .

My first recollection of the Masters was 1986, when Jack won. 'I remember him making a putt at 17 and lifting that putter up. Fourteen years later at the 2000 PGA Championship, I got to play with and against him – someone I looked up to.' It remains to be seen whether Woods will be at the business end of the Masters come Sunday but McIlroy relishes playing with his idol.

Kevin Carr, 34, from Woolacombe, Devon, has become the fastest man to run around the world completing the 16,300-mile mission in 621 days, beating the previous record by a day . Mr Carr ran across five continents during his epic 621-day challenge beating the previous record by a day . Mr Carr set off from Haytor on Dartmoor in July 2013 and returned last night after 621 days, during which he ran the equivalent of a marathon a day, crossed 26 countries and got through 16 pairs of shoes . Mr Carr was also the first man to complete the gruelling endurance run unsupported, and instead of a team carrying his equipment, he pushed it along himself in a buggy . Mr Carr also became the first man to complete the voyage unsupported by a team, instead pushing all of his kit along in a stroller that weighed twice as much as he does. He said: 'I've pushed my tired legs through most of Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. 'I have encountered some pretty scary things along the way, from packs of wilds dogs in Romania to the most extreme weather conditions imaginable. 'Most frightening of all however was coming face to face with bears. One of the bears stalked and then actively came for me. Mr Carr's journey took him through Australia, New Zealand, Europe, India, the US and Canada - though he said the highlight was the Andes mountains . Mr Carr pushes his buggy full of equipment, which weighed twice as much as him, through Dunedin in New Zealand during the middle of his adventure . The route took Mr Carr through most of Europe, including Lithuania (pictured). After crossing the finish line he said he had lost three stone during the trip . 'I used bear banger explosives that someone had given me and, after three misfires, thankfully my fourth attempt sent the bear packing.' He said during one 300-mile stretch full of bears and wolves he relied on people with short-distance radios to keep a check on him to make sure he wasn't eaten. He added: 'I've had to endure a lot of suffering too. I had severe heatstroke in India and have twice been hit by cars. 'I knew the size of the challenge but it was a little bit more of a headache dealing with the logistics and the traffic.

{"document": "(CNN)Can a prayer for diamonds actually turn up a gem? When you're exploring the fields at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Arkansas, the odds are higher than usual. \"Are you going to bless me and let me find a diamond today?\" That was Susie Clark's prayer on April 23, according to the state park service. Soon after, Clark, who is from Evening Shade, Arkansas, saw a 3.69-carat white, teardrop-shaped diamond in the plowed field. Inspired by her prayer, Clark named it the Hallelujah Diamond. She plans to keep it. The diamond, which is the largest found at the park so far this year, is about the size of a pinto bean, says park interpreter Waymon Cox. \"And it's the largest one found since April 16, 2014, when a 6.19-carat white diamond, named the Limitless Diamond, was found at the park,\" he said, according to a park press release. It's the 122nd diamond found at Crater of Diamonds this year. Visitors get to keep what they find at the state park's 37.5-acre search field, which is named for an ancient eruption that scattered the area with gems. The area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- anyone can dig for diamonds and keep them. It's not clear how much the diamond is worth, and park officials aren't trained to appraise them, according to the park website. But Oklahoman Tara Clymer sold a 3.85-carat diamond she found at the park last year for $20,000. 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders .

The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was cut in 1997 by the renowned diamond firm Lazare Kaplan International of New York. The now 1.09-carat diamond is on display at the park visitor center. The park stretches for more than 900 acres along the Little Missouri River, but the diamond field is the main attraction.

A wine bar banned its local vicar from coming in for a drink on Easter Sunday – because he was wearing sandals. The Reverend Andrew Dotchin, 58, a well-known local character popular with his parishioners, was celebrating the end of Lent when he was refused entry at The Wine Bar in Ipswich. He was told there were health and safety concerns, because a glass could fall on his foot. Rev Dotchin, who preaches at Whitton Parish Church, said: 'I was gobsmacked.

{"document": "She might be approaching her 89th birthday but nothing was going to stop the Queen from enjoying a ride in the spring sunshine this morning. The monarch, 88, was spotted trotting through Windsor Great Park aboard her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma. Joined by a groom on another of her Fell ponies, the Queen cut a relaxed figure as she enjoyed her ride but, as is her wont, eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves. Enjoying the sunshine: The Queen enjoys a ride on her Fell pony Carltonlima Emma . The Queen, who has never worn riding helmets, has been encouraged to wear the safety hats in the past but is reportedly reluctant to wear one because of her hair. Speaking in an interview last year, her racing trainer Ian Balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat. The Queen is said to have replied: 'I never have and you don’t have to have your hair done like I do.' Her Majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. Equine enthusiast: Her Majesty adores the ponies and breeds them at Hampton Court . No helmet: The Queen never wears a riding helmet, preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf . Cutting back: She has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury . Long term love: The Queen has ridden all her life and continues to breed several breeds of horse and pony . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. First love: The Queen's first pony was a tiny Shetland named Peggy who was given to her at the age of four . Familiar sight: The Queen riding her much-loved horse Burmese during Trooping the Colour . Seal of approval: A Fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the Queen at Hampton Court . One of the oldest equine breeds on the planet, Fell ponies like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, have roamed the moors of Cumbria since the Neolithic period. Docile, hardy and thick-set, the majority of Fell ponies are black, grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh. Highly prized by the Carvetii, the Iron Age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago, the ponies later caught the eye of the invading Romans and were used as trade goods all over the Empire. The Romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today. Originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall (similar to Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies), by the end of the Roman period, the average Fell was more than a hand higher. Another invader to fall in love with the Fell pony was the Vikings, who used the animals as pack ponies; a use continued by the Normans. By the 13th century, the Fell's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, Fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town, as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed. Although previously used in trotting races, the Fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s, when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families. Today, the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages, among them the Queen who breeds Fell ponies at her Hampton Court stud.

{"document": "A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .", "summary": "Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment .\nXiong allegedly tried to kidnap his 15-year-old girlfriend and force her to be his bride in a traditional Hmong marriage .\nIn Hmong culture, bride-napping is a frowned-upon tradition in which a male suitor kidnaps his bride if her family does not approve of the marriage .\nXiong pleaded guilty to sexual assault against a 13-year-old girl in 2009 when he was 15 ."}
{"document": "Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa . They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases. However, Neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred. Dr Simon Underdown, a principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and co-author of the study, said: 'As Neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease. 'When Homo sapiens came out of Africa they brought diseases with them. 'We know that Neanderthals were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them. 'Perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but Neanderthals could not.' The findings add to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought. Recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen, Neanderthals had sophisticated culture, were master tool makers and may even have had their own language. The new study suggests that Neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience. Indeed, there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs. Dr Underdown and his colleague Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a researcher in infectious diseases at Cambridge University and University College London, analysed recent genetic studies on Neanderthals and other early humans. They also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence. Infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis, shown above, may have been common in Neanderthals . Most evidence from the fossil record suggest that Neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle, but there are also signs of inflammation and infection. Their study, which is published on the open source database bioRxiv, contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the Holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock. Instead, they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when Neanderthals dominated much of Europe and Asia between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago, when they disappeared. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . They say pathogens like TB, typhoid and Crimean fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago. Genetic sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan - another early human ancestor - DNA has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species. These include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick-borne encephalitis. Dr Underdown said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern Europe that Neanderthals inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage. Other genes found in modern Papua New Guineans that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from Neanderthals. The fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like the skull above, are revealing more details about their lifestyles . Analysis of ancient DNA has also shown that Neanderthals carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning, or sepsis. Dr Underdown said: 'There are genetic signals in the Neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them. 'It had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements. 'Be here we have got Neanderthals being infected by these diseases long before those developments.'", "summary": "Anthropologists claim that Neanderthals suffered many modern diseases .\nDNA analysis has shown that they had immunity against common illnesses .\nBut they believe modern humans brought new infectious pathogens such as Heliocbacter pylori with them out of Africa and infected Neanderthals .\nThis suggests infectious diseases are much older than previously thought ."}
{"document": "Wladimir Klitschko has reached rare territory among heavyweight champions. Now, in his ninth year as champion, Klitschko is catching Joe Louis and Larry Holmes in successful defences. When Klitschko faces Bryant Jennings on April 25 at New York's Madison Square Garden, he will risk his heavyweight belt for the 18th time. A win over Jennings will place Klitschko within one successful defense of Holmes but he would still need six additional wins to match Louis' record of 25. Wladimir Klitschko works out in the ring in front of the media ahead of his fight against Bryant Jennings . Klitschko lands a right hand during a sparring session in front of the watching media in Florida . 'With all respect to Louis and Larry Holmes, they're icons for me, I don't want to be compared with them because they are fighters I always have looked up to,' Klitschko said. 'As an outsider (media) can observe the fights and title defenses, you keep track. I'm an insider.' Nonetheless, Klitschko has made deep inroads during his second heavyweight stint that began with a seventh-round technical knockout win over Chris Byrd for a sanctioning body title in April 2006. Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson never enjoyed a title run as long as the native of Ukraine and part-time Hollywood, Florida resident. 'My mind is in a tunnel; I'm getting ready for the next bout,' Klitschko said. 'And I'm excited about the challenge. I do not compare myself with the records of those guys - Joe Louis and Larry Holmes. I just enjoy my game.' Klitschko built the impressive streak of title defences at a time when American heavyweights have faded from contention. Until Deontay Wilder's victory over Bermane Stiverne on January 17, no American held a piece of the heavyweight title since 2006. Klitschko is closing in on the record number of defences of the heavyweight title set by Joe Louis . Victory for the Ukrainian will take him to within one win of Larry Holmes' 19 defences . Wilder looks for a lengthy reign while Jennings, of Philadelphia, seeks to tilt the division's power more toward to its once-dominant base. 'Every opponent is different and we will see how Bryant Jennings can hold the pressure,' Klitschko said. 'As my former coach, Emmanuel Steward said, `on fight night, when you step into the ring, welcome to big time boxing.' 'How is Bryant Jennings going to hold to big-time boxing and get along with that? We'll see.' Jennings earned the opportunity to face Klitschko after his split-decision victory over fellow contender Mike Perez last July. 'Bryant Jennings is going to bring a lot of excitement and a lot of energy into the ring,' Klitschko said. 'This fight is going to be nothing but exciting.' Jennings defends his unbeaten record when he takes on Klitschko later this month in New York . Klitschko is keen to face Deontay Wilder (left) in a unification clash later in his career . Klitschko believes boxing is enjoying a revival. Attention toward the sport has increased with the build-up to the mega-fight between welterweight champions Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2 in Las Vegas. And Klitschko also predicts a future unification bout between him and Wilder would be appealing to fight fans that distanced themselves from the heavyweight division after Tyson's retirement. 'The demand is shifting back and forth and during the time when boxing was less popular in the heavyweight division, because of the lack of good (American) prospects, it shifted to Europe,' said Klitschko, who will make his first US appearance in seven years. 'You cannot say boxing was dead or unpopular. The attention shifted to different continents. And now the demand for boxing is big and I'm really excited to be back in the States. 'I believe Deontay is an extremely talented athlete. We've sparred enough that we know each other well.

Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . This time Don King had Manila in mind as the next heavyweight stop for his globe-trotting circus. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, like Zaire's President Mobuto before him, saw sponsorship of the fight as a distraction from the poverty and social unrest in his country. It was Ali who became most distracted during the build-up. When invited to a photo-opportunity with Marcos and his infamously big-spending wife Imelda, he took his mistress Veronica Porsche along and introduced her as his wife. Mrs Belinda Ali watched that happen on US television and immediately flew to Manila to confront her husband, loudly, in his hotel suite. Ali returned to his customary psychological baiting of his opponents. He had insulted Frazier before their first fight and did so again chanting: 'It will be Killa and a Thrilla and a Chilla when I get The Gorilla in Manila.' Thus the title for the fight, The Thrilla in Manila, was coined. Ali pictured alongside his infamously big-spending wife Mrs Belinda Ali in September 1975 . Frazier, the quiet man, was plotting a strategy of breaking down Ali with shots to the stomach, ribs, kidneys and liver, quoting the old ring maxim: 'If you kill the body, the head will die.' Ali would target the Frazier head and won the early rounds while his legs were at their freshest. But it was impossible for him to keep dancing in the pressure-cooker heat, with the ring temperature reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit. As Muhammad started slowing, Joe began Smokin'. They would engage in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game. Ali was forced to lower his guard as they landed more than 100 blows to the head between them, each of such force that any one of them would have stopped lesser fighters. Ali supplemented those power shots with his quick jabs and combinations and thereby inflicted more of the facial swelling. Boxing greats Frazier and Ali pictured in the ring on October 1, 1975, for the Thrilla in Manila . Ali and Frazier engaged in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game . Frazier's eyes began closing in the ninth. By the time he came out for the 13th he could barely see and Ali sent his gum-shield flying with the second of two massive right hooks. Exhausted though he was, Ali went for the Killa in the 14th. Although the monstrous barrage which sent Frazier reeling and staggering could not put him down, it was enough to bring a sensational end to an epic battle. Ali ordered his corner-man Herbert Muhammad to cut off his gloves, saying he could not go on. But before he could do so Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch called a halt. A relieved Ali famously said: 'This is the closest to death I have ever been.' Frazier begged to be allowed to see out the 15th and final round but Futch told him: 'It's over. No-one will ever forget what you did here today.' Frazier never forgave him. Not fully. Nor Ali for the trilogy of insults. Ali defied the rigours of Parkinson's to attend Frazier's funeral. Ali lifts his arms in the air after defeating Frazier in the 14th round, but later attended his great opponent's funeral when he died at the age of 67 .", "summary": "Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao is now just eight days away .\nSportsmail's Jeff Powell has been counting down the greatest fights .\nIn the fifth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, we have Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier, the Thrilla in Manila .\nIt was said to have come five years late, much like Mayweather v Pacquiao .\nYet those doubting the two greats in their 30s were spectacularly wrong ."}

About a week ago, Laney Griner, Justin's wife and Sammy's mother, created a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $75,000 to help cover the medical expenses that go along with a kidney transplant. The campaign is already a success. By Wednesday it had topped its goal. Griner told The Daily Dot that her husband was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2006 and suffered complete kidney failure three years later. \"One can only survive with no natural kidney function ... for so long,\" Laney Griner said. \"His energy and mood are affected; he can no longer work, and he spends 12 hours a week in dialysis clinic. \"Having been on dialysis for this long greatly increases his risks of developing further complications. The only way to save his life is to get a transplant. There's no other way around that,\" she said. The family doesn't know when a kidney might become available.  Their GoFundMe page has a link for potential donors. Sammy's Internet fame began in 2007 when his mom posted a picture of him on a beach with a fist full of sand and a satisfied look on his face.

A Colorado mother has been arrested for allegedly giving her teenage son a pot brownie that caused him to jump out of a third-story glass window 'without hesitation.' In a bizarre twist, the alleged victim in the case, 19-year-old Austin Essig, took to the Fort Collins police department's Facebook page to describe the strange 'trip' he experienced after eating the brownie. His mother Julieane Jablonski, 38, was booked on suspicion of providing marijuana to a minor and felony tampering with a witness, the Fort Collins Police Department said on Wednesday. Detectives allege that Jablonski told the teen after he was hospitalized for the fall on April 14 'he needed to recant his statement to the police and lie about where the marijuana came from,' according to an arrest report obtained by the Coloradoan newspaper. After the incident, a Facebook user that appears to be Essig commented on the Fort Collins police post about the incident. 'It was quite the trip for a brownie, I can tell you that much,' he wrote on Tuesday. He added: 'I can say I followed dosage instructions (only ate one, as opposed to my mid - incident statement), but can't honestly comment on how I got ahold of it. 'I can also say that my reaction to the marijuana was far from normal, and that this isn't common at all. Currently researching the subject further.' Austin Essig, 19, jumped out of the third-floor window from this apartment complex earlier this month 'without hesitation' after eating a marijuana-laced brownie . 'It was quite a trip': The alleged victim in the case, Essig, commented on the police report about his own injury . The next day, detectives arrested his mother. Marijuana is legal to buy and consume recreationally in Colorado - but only for people over age 21. Buying marijuana for a teenager offers similar penalties to providing alcohol for minors in other states. Essig suffered non-life-threatening injuries when he jumped out of the third-story window - through the glass and all. Witnesses say he began acting strangely after consuming the pot brownie and then suddenly jump 'without hesitation.' Police confiscated what was left of the edible to test it for THC levels. Critics contend that the levels of the hallucinogen in Colorado marijuana is extremely high - often too high for people who are not regular users to tolerate. It was the latest of several incidents of pot users harming . themselves that authorities in Colorado have confronted since . retail sales of the drug began there last year.

She said: 'When I started digging, I realised he's lived in different women's houses not paying a penny and moving from one to the next for years so I thought, you know what, this can stop here. 'There are kids I didn't even know existed and the more I was digging the more I was like \"oh my God I don't even know the person I've been dating\" and that's how it all came about. 'I started going back through, thinking things aren't adding up when he was going missing. 'A girl rang me out of the blue and said she'd been seeing him. But he completely convinced me that she just a nutter who knows him, but then a few weeks later, when he was going missing once a week still, I thought things aren't adding up.' She then decided to change the webpage. 'It's my website, I bought the domain name, made him a nice website because he can't read and write', she said. 'I did his website then I thought you know what this goes back all that time so I just thought it's all over his truck, the name of his firm, that he drives so I wanted to oust him.' On the webpage, it explains how Mr Meade's address 'changes every few months', as does his phone number . The website now says how he was 'dumped and this resulted in him having to woo a new woman and quick as he was effectively homeless.' It adds: 'He was fortunate enough to find someone to take him in within days of dating.' On the sidebar of the page, under 'address' it reads 'changes every few months - moves from one woman's house to the next'. Today, Miss Morgan continued to shame her former boyfriend by posting a series of YouTube clips of his answer phone messages where he issues an apology. Mr Meade, of Orpington, Kent, told MailOnline: 'She's trying to ruin someone's life. If that's what someone wants to do, I will carry on, it's not affecting my life. 'If anyone sees the website, it just shows what she is capable of. I hope she finds happiness in her life. She should really get out more. 'She's just a lunatic and it was a crazy six months. I'm not the only person to have cheated on her, but what does that say about her?' Confirming his new relationship, he said: 'It's not a new person. I've known her for all my life, but she (Lisa) is trying to ruin my life.' He added how he was not yet divorced as his estranged wife 'won't do it yet'. His estranged wife, Joanne, 35, who lives in Weald, Sevenoaks, told the Sun: 'I think it's great what she's done. It serves him right.'", "summary": "Lisa Morgan, 40, amended site to claim her boyfriend had been unfaithful .\nTop of the World Roofing website says it's 'ceased trading at present'\nSite now claims boss was 'unfortunately found out to be cheating again'\nMet Sean Meade, 45, in August but soon grew wary when he was never in .\nContacted his estranged wife, Jo, who told her he had cheated on her too ."}
{"document": "'The General': Mohammed Suleman Khan, 43, was sent to prison for four years last April but faces ten more years if he does not pay back £2.2m . A jailed tax fraudster who hid his wealth in the UK while building an estate  in Pakistan modelled on Buckingham Palace must pay back £2.2million within six months or face a  ten more years in jail. Mohammed Suleman Khan, 43, was sent to prison for  four years last April after defrauding the taxman of £450,000. His nine-year scam was exposed after police raided his Birmingham home and discovered plans for his own mansion in Pakistan, complete with library, cinema and servant quarters. Serving inmate Khan faced a proceeds of crime hearing at Liverpool Crown Court last week and was ordered to pay £2.2million within six months. If he fails to hand over the cash he faces a further ten years in prison. The tax fraudster had contested the order, brought by West Midlands Police and prosecuted at court by Andrew Smith QC. Judge Andrew Menary QC presided over the week-long case, which heard details of Khan's complicated financial affairs. The original tax fraud court case heard how he had lived in a gated £500,000 house in Moseley and drove a BMW, but had no obvious job. His family home belonged to relatives and only small amounts of money went through his bank accounts. Yet while he was careful to avoid showing trappings of wealth in the UK, detectives from West Midlands Police's Force CID discovered he had secretly paid for the £2.3million mansion to be built in Pakistan. In court his defence team portrayed him as a legitimate businessman who had earned around £400,000 over the nine-year period from debt collecting and other business interests in the UK and abroad. But police found no evidence of a legitimate debt collecting company and their investigation proved he had netted more than £1million during that period, without paying the required tax and National Insurance. Inspiration: Khan built himself a vast estate in Pakistan, left, inspired by Buckingham Palace, right . A search of Khan's Birmingham home after his arrest uncovered plans for the 'palace' in the Attock region of Pakistan. The outer shell and roof of the building had been completed by Khan at a cost of £893,000. Once finished, the property would have been valued at £2.3 million. Khan was known in criminal circles as 'The General' and his prosecution sent shockwaves around Birmingham's criminal fraternity, who had held him up to near 'mythical' status. One gangland source said: 'In recent years he was said to have turned religious but this man was still feared and his dealings and movements were shrouded in mystery. 'Not many people had even ever set eyes on him. He had this kind of mythical status where people only spoke his name in hushed tones. Most people referred to him simply as 'The General' which gave an indication of the kind of status he had in the community.' A police source close to the investigation into the unsolved murder of of Tony Yaqub in Birmingham in 2004 said: 'Khan was arrested after returning to Birmingham from Pakistan a few days after the murder and he was questioned at length'. Khan was later released without charge. An appeal was later made on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme but Mr Yaqub’s killers have continued to evade police and no motive for his murder has ever been revealed by police.", "summary": "Mohammed Suleman Khan lived extravagant lifestyle without a job .\nPolice found he was building his own Buckingham Palace in Pakistan .\nKnown as 'The General' in UK gangland and  jailed for four years last year .\nJudge orders him to pay back £2.2m or face another ten years in jail ."}

However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There’s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we’re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released.

The Prime Minister is apparently so proud to be posh he was happy to be pictured eating a hotdog with a knife and fork. The bizarre dining etiquette during a campaign visit to Dorset was almost certainly designed to avoid a repeat of Ed Miliband's disastrous attempt at eating a bacon sandwich. Scroll down for video . David Cameron ate his hotdog with cutlery as he enjoyed lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota in the sunshine during a visit to Poole in Dorset . It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year . Few people can appear attractive while eating in public, but on the campaign trail a combination of hunger and not wishing to cause offence to hosts means it can be tricky to avoid. Mr Cameron's pitstop at a garden in Poole, Dorset yesterday include a spot of a lunch. The Tory leader loaded his plate with potato salad, cucumber, tomato and a hotdog before settling down next to Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota. But he surprised onlookers with his eating style, picking up a knife and fork to chop the hotdog. The PM has a chequered history with hotdogs. In 2010 he caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions. And in March 2012 he was said to have tried eating one sideways while at a basketball game with President Obama. He also sparked a mini-storm after opting for ketchup of mustard, the condiment of choice for many Americans. The Prime Minister obviously enjoyed his lunch, and was pictured leaning back in his chair in the sunshine . In a new interview the Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing, and refuses to change the way he speaks or behaves . While aides may worry about the impression Mr Cameron gave by eating his BBQ food with cutlery, the man himself is unconcerned. In an interview to be broadcast tonight, he makes clear he is not going to change the way he behaves to hide his 'poshness'. The Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing. He tells ITV's Tonight programme: 'I went to a very posh school, I had a very privileged upbringing with parents who were incredibly loving and brilliant.

The agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption, but indicated it was \"stronger than the first one.\" About 23½ inches (60 centimeters) of ash fell in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. Authorities issued a red alert for the towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Both are popular tourist destinations. A 12-mile (20 kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were assisting with the evacuations of more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew and later there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" said one Puerto Montt resident. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962.  There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996.

{"document": "Manchester United thumped Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday to move four points clear of their cross-town rivals. Louis van Gaal's men continued their excellent run of form and a Champions League spot looks all but assured now for them after their Manchester derby victory. Manchester City, meanwhile, have gone from joint top on New Year's Day to 12 points off the leaders and looking over their shoulders at the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton. Here are five things we learned from the Manchester derby. UNITED NOW ON COURSE FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . For much of the season United seemed to be in false position, with their performances hardly giving the impression they belonged in the top four. But now - whether by luck or design - something seems to have clicked for Louis van Gaal and United are now playing with a cutting edge and with confidence. A Champions League return now looks likely. Manchester United celebrated a 4-2 win over their closest rivals at Old Trafford on Sunday . CRISIS FOR CITY AND PELLEGRINI . City's results since going joint top of the Barclays Premier League on New Year's Day make abysmal reading for a side of their quality. Their run of four league wins in 12 games - during a period in which they also went out of two cup competitions - surely constitutes a crisis for a club with their expectations. The already considerable scrutiny on manager Manuel Pellegrini will increase another notch. Manuel Pellegrini is under increasing pressure after a woeful second half of the season for his team . FELLAINI CONTINUES TO HIT BACK . For much of his first season at United, Marouane Fellaini looked out of touch and possibly out of his depth. That has all changed in the last few months as he has become increasingly important to Van Gaal. The midfielder uses his strength to great effect as United continue to loft the ball forward to him and teams find him difficult to dispossess. Marouane Fellaini celebrates after heading Manchester United into the lead in the first half . Fellaini has been key in United's recent run of form to lift them into third place in the Premier League . CITY TEAM COMING TO END OF LINE . There can be little doubt that the City team, the core of which has won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup, is coming to the end of its lifespan. Reinvestment is clearly needed in the summer and, on this evidence, the back four would be a priority. Yaya Toure looks on dejected during Manchester City's thrashing at Old Trafford on Sunday . UNITED NEED TO IMPROVE DEFENSIVELY TOO . For all that United went on to dominate the game, City started superbly, reminding everyone of the quality they do still possess. They troubled United repeatedly at the back, where the central defensive partnership of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones again looked vulnerable.

{"document": "Injuries: The exploding phone caused injuries so deep that doctors could see Hanghang's jawbone . A 12-year-old in central China was seriously injured when his phone exploded while it was charging. The boy, known only as Hanghang, was using the old handset as an alarm when he woke up early for school and started to play with it. He said the phone felt hot and then blew up in his face, exposing part of his jawbone and embedding fragments in his arms and legs. 'I played with the phone for a few minutes,' he said. 'The phone felt hot then it suddenly exploded and all I could see were my hands covered in blood and blood dripping from my face. 'I used a towel to stem the blood and washed my hands under the tap then I called the ambulance.' Hanghang, from Pingdingshan City, in the Henan province, told reporters at People's Daily Online that when the explosion happened he didn't dare tell his parents and called the ambulance service himself following the accident last week. He is now being treated in Ping Mei Group Hospital and is expected to need several operations to repair the damage. Hurt: Hanghang pictured lying in a hospital bed after a mobile phone exploded, injuring his face and hand . Doctors said he had 4cm injury to his face which exposed part of his lower jawbone as well as trauma to his left hand as well as lower legs and knees. He underwent emergency surgery before he was sent to the burns unit and onto the plastic surgery inpatient department. Experts believe there are three main reasons a phone may explode like this. The first is the battery itself is damaged and although it is connected to a charger it isn’t actually charging. A short circuit is another possible cause but this is a less likely unless the phone has been illegally modified in some way. The most common cause  is improper charging. It affects lithium batteries more where the phone may be fully charged but is left on charging or if phone is used whilst charging may lead to lithium batteries overheating. Overheating and poor contact can result in a sudden discharge of a current and cause an explosion. Tips include to avoid using the phone while the battery is being charged by disconnecting the phone from charger before connecting a call or using any of its functions. Ensure it is not over-charged by removing the electric supply when the battery is fully charged. If the battery seems to have swollen, it should be replaced immediately. Hanghang said he could not be sure of the type of phone as it was one of several old phones. He said: 'It was the battery that exploded. I have heard my classmates talk about this happening but I never thought it would happen to me.'", "summary": "Hanghang was playing on the phone after waking up early for school .\nHe said the phone felt hot and then blew up in his hand .\nIt left his jawbone exposed and injuries to his hand, leg and knee .\nExperts blame battery as most likely cause of blast ."}

Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver, had already lost his brother Azdid in the earthquake and said he was thankful rescue workers had managed to lift his son to safety.. He said: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed.

Sunthalia's home was destroyed in Jharibar, a village in the hilly Gorkha district of Nepal close to the quake's epicentre. With her husband away in India and with no help in sight, she was forced to retrieve the bodies of her 10-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son herself. But she spotted her other son, aged four, still moving. 'I could see my son's fingers fluttering through the pile of stones. 'That's how I could see him and save him,' Sunthalia said, sitting listlessly on the ground, her son by her side, with the stench of dead cattle still in the ruins of her house. Nepalese rescuers, supported by an American disaster response team, had been working for hours to free him. L.B. Basnet, the police officer who crawled into a gap to reach Tamang, said he was surprisingly responsive. ‘He thanked me when I first approached him,’ said Basnet. ‘He told me his name, his address, and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near to him.’ When Tamang was lifted out, his face was covered in dust, and medics had put an IV drop into his arm. He appeared stunned, and his eyes blinked in the sunlight as workers carried him away. Andrew Olvera, an urban search and rescue member with the U.S. Agency for International Development's Disaster Assistance Response Team, said the operation to save the boyd was dangerous. Twisted ropes of steel reinforcing rods were all that stopped huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors hung down in front of the building like curtains. 'It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.'.Mr Olvera added. More than 5,500 people are confirmed to have died after Saturday’s mammoth earthquake, with authorities fearing that the death toll could rise to 10,000. Thousands of houses and other buildings have been destroyed, and the country has been plagued by more than 70 aftershocks in the five days since the disaster.

{"document": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"", "summary": "The number of new HIV infections in Indiana has grown to 142 cases .\nSome families in isolated communities use illegal drugs and share needles as a \"community activity,\" a health official says .\nPublic health officials urge vigilance to stop the outbreak from gaining ground ."}

{"document": "There is an insufficient supply of whooping cough vaccine in Australia, according to Queensland Health. However, medical professionals insist the resource shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies, children and pregnant women. It comes less than a month after the death of 32-day-old Riley who died after contracting whooping cough. His parents Catherine and Greg are now leading a campaign, urging adults to vaccinate themselves and their children to prevent more infant deaths from the terrible disease. The adult whooping cough vaccine will not be available in Australia until July, according to ABC News. However, although whooping cough is less severe in adults, infected adults do pose a serious risk for infants and children who are not vaccinated. Scroll down for video . Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley's father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his 'darling little angel Riley' 'The one product that is in short supply is not part of the formal national immunisation program, but is a booster dose that's used generally by GPs for adults,' Queensland Health senior medical officer Dr Alun Richards told ABC News. 'We have sufficient stocks to vaccinate children as part of the school-based vaccination program.' On March 15, two days before baby Riley died, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. 'If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at (Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital). Please keep him in your thoughts!,' she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Riley's father Greg added. Dr Richards could not confirm why the shortage has taken place but told ABC that it is not abnormal. His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'I don't know whether it's because of increased demand in the world or if it's another issue, but there are vaccination shortages from time to time,' he said. 'There are other preparations on the market [and] they're not all in short supply.' For people opting to be vaccinated against whooping cough, they may be deferred by their GP until more supplies are available. 'These people can return when supplies are again available,' Dr Jeannette Young told ABC News. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' Whooping cough (also known as 'pertussis') is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother's antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it's usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the 'whoop' sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.

The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year. Further delays to Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into the war were reported by BBC’s Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news. It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour. But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry, which began in 2009, will not be published until 2016. Newsnight’s Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016. Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion. The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry. Earlier this year, he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron’s claim, that Labour had got the publication delayed.

Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised. Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them, often running to hundreds of pages. The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses.

However, President Obama did confess to having a bit of not-so-healthy Easter chocolate when asked by a reporter at the event. 'I had a few, I have to admit,' Mr Obama said. Notably not in attendance were first daughters Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, Obama. The president said they were occupied by 'a little school stuff going on'.

{"document": "Made famous by their 'matchy matchy' style and twin-like looks (despite the five year age difference), the Melbourne based fashion duo Jess, 22, and Stef, 27, Dadon are now set to take their crazy style collaborations to a new level. The sisters have teamed up with 'Print All Over Me' - an innovative online New York-based company that allows you to digitally design your own prints - and Buffalo shoes, the brand behind the Spice Girls' trademark platforms. Introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the U.S., the girls knew it was a match made in heaven. 'We both have a love of colour and prints and so we said lets do something crazy together,' says Stef. Scroll down for video . Quirky collab: Sister duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up  with  New York company ' Print All Over Me' Cocktails and creativity: The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line 'Twoobs' The photo-shoot was their own idea, which according to Jess they 'threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories. While the duo look posed and polished in the pics, they let us in on a little secret, according to the 'How Two Live' girls, they insist they don't actually like modelling, despite the 1732 posts on Instagram that would suggest otherwise. 'We don’t like to model, so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they don’t see us,' says Jess. Candy coloured palettes: Stef, 27 (left) and Jess, 22 (right) Dadon have over 111,000 followers on Instagram . Steph says they use the term 'modelling' loosely as they don't see themselves as professional models, they just happen to be in the photos showcasing the clothes. The photo shoot which took place in Sydney's Luna Park provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy, clown-like antics of the collaboration. 'They closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot. It provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop.' Model shy:The girls admit while they love wearing clothes, they are actually camera shy . Theme this: Sydney's theme park 'Luna Park' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration . The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout . Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls . First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you’re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive . Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style . Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We’re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently. We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo . The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers . And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like ‘\"I love what you’re wearing, you girls look so crazy,\"' says Jess. 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe, she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said . Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess.", "summary": "The stylish sisters 'How Two Live' collaborate with print and shoe brands .\nThe collaboration is with US company ' Print all over me' that lets you design and customise a print to wear or sell commercially .\nAlso featured  is Buffalo shoes, makers of the Spice Girls platforms .\nThe vibrant sisters have 111,000 fans on Instagram ."}
{"document": "A woman who works as a professional ‘humiliatrix’ has revealed how she earns more than one dollar per minute indulging the subservient fantasies of men around the world. Ceara Lynch, from Portland, Oregon, takes the more traditional dominatrix idea a step further, not just dominating her customers but demeaning, shaming and generally humiliating them. And the 28-year-old entrepreneur says that making money this way — which she has been doing since she was 17 — has been a dream. Risqué business: Ceara Lynch, 28, says her career began when she realized how much money she could make from selling her used underwear online; her first pair sold for $70 . In a recent interview with Salon, Ceara explains that she got started in the industry by accident. When she was 17, Ceara was on a dating website when one particular suitor intrigued her; the meaner she was to him, the more interested in her he became. She went on to seek out similar men, eventually finding a website called Ebanned where she could sell her used underwear. Her first pair sold for $70. A tame entrance into the world of humiliating men for money soon escalated to selling more personal items online, taking provocative phone calls, and performing live webcam shows. Taking control: 'Guys really like the idea of me ruining them in this way,' Ceara says . Real-life dating: Ceara says she's up-front about her job when she's dating, and she's had three serious relationships over the course of her career . 'I make most of my money from videos,' she says, adding that custom videos cost $1 per minute and subscribers pay a monthly fee of $39.99 for access to her site. 'They are [point of view]-style videos, which means it’s just me and the camera, and I am looking at the camera and talking to the camera so that the viewer feels like I’m talking to them.' 'I just tap into various fetishes and they’re all just under the umbrella of [female dominance]. I always play a dominant role, and I tap into things like cuckolding, small penis humiliation, foot fetish, toilet slavery, giantess — which is this fetish where guys imagine this giant woman that’s going to come and crush them with her feet or swallow them whole — different stuff like that.' Besides paying for subscriptions and purchasing the personal items that Ceara sells online, customers can also mail Ceara cash, buy her gift cards to Amazon, Southwest Airlines, or a massage parlor, or purchase items off her Amazon wishlist, which includes a $399.99 GoPro, $1,295 Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and a $23 Pikachu adult cosplay costume. No secret: Friends and family know what Ceara does for a living, and her dad thought she was a 'genius' when he learned how she was making money . While such interests might scare off some people, Ceara likes the fact that she is privy to intimate knowledge that her customers don't necessarily reveal in their personal lives. 'I think it’s fascinating and I think it’s also flattering, in a way, that guys are telling me things that they don’t tell anyone else,' she says. Ceara also isn't quite as excited about humiliating her customers as they are about being humiliated, which she says makes it easy for her to compartmentalize and separate her job from her personal life. 'I do enjoy my work, I think it’s really fun and I get a kick out of it ... But I definitely don’t like it in the same way that my clients like it.'", "summary": "Ceara Lynch, 28, is paid to indulge men’s fetish fantasies, which often include elements of humiliation .\nShe began her career at age 17 selling used underwear online and has gone on to create web videos .\nCeara now owns a minimum of $1 a minute for making custom videos .\nShe 'gets a kick out of' her job, which includes hearing the secret fantasies of thousands of men ."}
{"document": "Child welfare authorities say the father of a three-year-old girl found alone near a suburban Chicago forest preserve left her in a trash can. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services spokesman Andrew Flach tells the Chicago Tribune that an initial investigation found that the girl's father put her in a trash can and drove away. Faiz Ikramulla, 35, was arrested and charged on Thursday with aggravated kidnapping. The little girl is believed to be named Aliya. Aggravated kidnapping: Faiz Ikramulla, 35 (left), was arrested and charged on Thursday with aggravated kidnapping after allegedly dumping his three-year-old daughter, Aliya (right), in an Illinois trash can . Scene: The child was found by a passer-by wandering near Milwaukee Avenue and Palatine Road in Prospect Heights, Illinois around 6:30 pm Tuesday . He's jailed in Van Buren County, Michigan, pending extradition proceedings. A passer-by found the girl Tuesday evening along a roadside near the forest preserve in Prospect Heights. She was crying and waving her hands. The Cook County Sheriff's Office says the girl could only provide her first name and was identified after investigators learned her mother was in the process of filing missing person reports for Aliya and Ikramulla. It was then they realized Ikramulla was wanted in relation to Aliya's kidnapping and that there was warrant out for his arrest. Police in Van Buren County, Michigan, notified Cook County Sheriff’s police and said they had located Ikramulla and arrested him. Both of the girl’s parents were initially under investigation, but authorities said there are no plans to arrest the girl’s mother, who is cooperating with DCFS investigators, The Tribune reported.

{"document": "A woman who was sexually abused as a child by her step-father has spoken out for the first time after a confession to her fiancé led to her attacker being jailed. Kim Hill, from Suffolk, has bravely waived her right to anonymity and spoken about how she was abused by Derek Osborne from the age of four. The now 31-year-old revealed she was forced to dress up in her mother's lingerie at the age of eight, and was even made to watch pornographic films. Kim Hill (left) was abused for years by her step-father but never revealed her past until her partner Rob (right) encouraged her to approach the police about her attacker. The couple pictured on their wedding day in 2013 . For years, Kim bottled up the painful memories until she met her husband Rob, 34, who guessed that she had been abused and helped to put Derek behind bars 20 years after the offences. While planning their wedding in 2013, Rob asked his fiancée if she had been abused as a child due to her withdrawn nature. His question finally prompted Kim to confess what happened to her. The mother-of-two says that Rob's question finally gave her the nudge that she needed to reveal her past. 'I'd waited my whole life to hear that question. I was desperate for someone to bring it up, so I could tell them the truth. Derek Osborne (left) abused Kim (right as a child aged seven) from a young age encouraging her to get into his bed for 'cuddles' At the age of nine Derek (pictured) forced Kim (pictured left as a child) to dress up in her mother's lingerie and watch porn films . 'When Rob asked me it was my chance to share the painful secret I'd been hiding – that the man I had called dad had abused me.' She told Rob how her step-father made her climb into bed with him and kiss and cuddle him. He even attacked her two days after her 12th birthday, while taking her out for a celebratory meal. Speaking about the abuse, Kim, who married Rob in 2013, said: 'I didn't know any different so I accepted what he was doing as normal. 'I saw him as my dad. I just thought my dad loved me very much.' Kim's biological father died when she was young and she was aged three when Derek began a relationship with her mother. She says that as a young child Derek's attention was originally welcomed in her large family. 'I scrambled for mum's attention with my three siblings. But I was always Derek's favourite. 'He'd come and tuck me into bed while Mum watched television downstairs.' But the attention soon turned sexual. She said: 'He would kiss me on the lips. Kim never revealed her past until Rob asked her if she had been abused ahead of their wedding . 'He often called me into his bed at night for a cuddle, so he could touch me under the covers. 'I was too young to know how wrong it was. I thought nothing of it. But years went by and the touching became more intimate.' Aged seven, Kim was taught sex education at school which soon made her realise that her step-father's actions were not normal. She said: 'I found out at school how babies are made. 'I was horrified, all I could think was, \"What if I have a baby growing inside me?\" 'I knew how upset mum would be if she found out and I'd get into so much trouble.' Kim was too scared  to approach anybody about her attacker and the abuse continued. She said: 'When I was nine, he forced me to dress up in mum's underwear, then he made me watch sick porn films. 'I didn't know any different so I accepted it as normal.' But that all changed when aged 10, Kim saw a television programme about sexual abuse. She said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I realised my dad was abusing me. 'Next time he tried to touch me I was in tears and pushed him away. Although he was angry, I stood my ground. Part of me wanted to tell mum, but I didn't want to hurt her.' But weeks later, her mother sat her down with some news that would come as a welcome relief. 'She told me that her and my stepdad were splitting up. Finally, I could escape him.' However to Kim's horror her mother wanted to keep Derek around as a father figure. For her 12th birthday, he took her out for a celebratory dinner. But he pounced when they were alone at his house afterwards and performed a sex act on her. She said: 'My feet were kicking as hard as I could but I wasn't strong enough to push him away. 'A look of anger spread across his face as he tried to hold me down. 'After, I felt disgusting. That was the last time he abused me. Afterwards he moved away with a new partner.' Ahead of the wedding Kim reported the abuse to the police where it was revealed Derek had abused other girls . Although she had finally escaped her attacker Kim was still living with the effects of the abuse. She said: 'I'd become so withdrawn, and jumped whenever anyone brushed past and touched me.' Although Kim met a man aged 18 and had a daughter at 23, the relationship did not work out. She found it difficult to trust and stayed away from the dating scene until a friend set her up with Rob. She says that right from the start Rob offered her huge support and she found him trustworthy. 'I wasn't sure and it was the first proper date I'd had since having my little girl. 'He talked about his sister, who's also a single mum and how difficult she's found it. 'From the very beginning, Rob was so understanding.' Kim and her daughter moved in with Rob after six months and just weeks later in August 2010 he proposed. Kim said she was able to seek justice after confessing all to Rob. Pictured on their wedding day . Kim has began to visit counselling sessions and says she is beginning to move on . The couple had a son in January 2012 and started planning the big day. She said 'Me and Rob shared everything, but I still didn't dare tell him what dad had done. We'd started making plans and wanted the perfect venue.' While searching for wedding venues, Rob asked her if she had been abused as a child. The question came as a huge shock to Kim. She said: 'I broke down in tears. I didn't know how he could guess. 'He said that I was different to other women because I was withdrawn. He encouraged me to tell mum what had happened. 'And with his support the next day I called the police.' After her brave confession Kim discovered that she was not alone and Derek had attacked a string of victims. 'I was the first victim to come forward but soon other victims spoke out and said Derek had abused them too. ' Kim has started her own blog to share her experiences and inspire others . When he was arrested, Derek denied all the offences and even claimed one of the girls had made sexual advances towards him. With the trial looming, in September 2013 Kim and Rob tied the knot. She said: 'I didn't think of Derek once. He might have destroyed my childhood, but he wasn't going to ruin the best day of my life.' In May 2014, Derek, then 72, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court where he admitted 16 counts dating from 1982 and 2004, including eight of indecent assault and seven of indecency with a child, related to Kim and two other schoolgirls. He also admitted raping another woman. He was jailed for 21 years. In October 2014 one count of gross indecency with a child, not relating to Kim, was quashed at the Court of Appeal in London, but his sentence remained the same. Kim said: 'I went to see him sentenced. He was so pathetic and frail, he was unrecognisable.' Judge John Holt said Derek's victims had all suffered 'devastating' psychological effects. He said a probation officer who interviewed Derek had assessed him as 'dangerous' and said he had shown 'very little' genuine remorse. Now he is behind bars, Kim says that she has been able to begin to move on. 'I've started counselling and healing sessions with the Happiness Foundation. They're helping me to accept it and move on. 'Rob is there with me every step of the way and I know he's so proud. I've also started a blog about everything I've been through. 'I've had so many victims of sexual abuse thank me for telling my story and showing you can put your abuser behind bars – even years later.'", "summary": "Kim Hill was abused by her step-father from a young age .\nHe forced her to wear lingerie and watch 'sick porn' films aged nine .\nKim never revealed what had happened until she met her husband Rob .\nWith his encouragement Kim reported her abuser and saw him sentenced .\nDerek Osborne was jailed for 21 years in 2013 aged 72 .\nHe confessed to abusing other girls as well as raping another woman .\nKim has now set up a blog to help other victims of sexual assault ."}

{"document": "A new HIV treatment pioneered using an antibody to attack the virus could lead to a new vaccine to prevent the infection. The first results to emerge from patient trials reveal the experimental therapy can dramatically reduce the level of virus in a patient's blood - their viral load. The scientists behind the discovery believe their findings offer new strategies for fighting or even preventing HIV infection. The antibody was designed by researchers to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells. As a result patients injected with the neutralising antibody during the trials saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral load. Scientists at the Rockefeller University in New York believe a new antibody therapy could pave the way for an HIV vaccine after clinical trials revealed the treatment resulted in a 300-fold decrease in the amount of HIV, pictured, in sufferers' blood . In a person infected with HIV, there is an ongoing battle between the virus and the body's immune system. As the body produces new antibodies that target the virus, the infection mutates to escape, managing to stay a few steps ahead. The team of scientists at Rockefeller University in New York now believe that using synthetic antibodies that attached to the surface of proteins on the outer membrane of the HIV virus, could offer an alternative treatment to the anti-retroviral drugs currently used. They hope the breakthrough will result in new therapeutic vaccines. HIV antibodies previously tested in humans had shown disappointing results, but the antibody tested at Rockefeller University belongs to a new generation of broadly neutralising antibodies that potently fight a wide range of HIV strains. Healthy gay men should be given anti-retroviral drugs to 'slash the number of cases of HIV', a groundbreaking study published earlier this year suggested. The Proud study, conducted in England, provides the first evidence that preventative HIV treatment is highly effective in a real-world setting. It showed that pre-exposure to the HIV drug Truvada can reduce the risk of infection in men-who-have-sex-with-men  by as much as 86 per cent. Previous research had suggested that preventive treatment might cut HIV infection rates but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice. 'One antibody alone, like one drug alone, will not be sufficient to suppress viral load for a long time because resistance will arise,' said Dr Marina Caskey, co-first author of the study. 'What's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent.' The research showed the new antibody therapy was effective against 195 of 237 HIV strains. The immune systems of people infected with HIV naturally produce broadly neutralising antibodies in 10 to 30 per cent of sufferers, but only after several years of infection. By that time, the virus has typically evolved and mutated to a point rendering the powerful antibodies ineffective. However, by isolating and cloning these antibodies, researchers are able to harness them as therapeutic agents to use against HIV infections that have had less time to evolve. As part of the new study, uninfected and HIV-infected people were given a single dose of the antibody intravenously, and monitored for 56 days. At the highest dose level - 30mg per kilo of weight - all eight infected people treated showed up to a 300-fold decrease in the amount of HIV virus measured in their blood. Most of those participants reached their lowest viral load just one week after treatment. The study marks the first time the new generation of HIV antibodies has been tested in humans. Dr Marina Caskey, co-first author of the study, said: 'What's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent.' (File picture) Dr Caskey said further trials could result in the antibodies being used in conjunction with existing anti-retroviral drugs to maintain better control over the infection to prevent the onset of Aids. She said antibody therapy might require treatment once every few months, compared with daily doses of antiretroviral drugs, currently the front line treatment for the virus. Besides the possibility of treatment, the study also raises hopes for an HIV vaccine. Dr Caskey said that if researchers can induce an uninfected person's immune system to generate potent antibodies such as that tested, it might be enough to block the HIV infection before it can be established. The study was published in the journal Nature.", "summary": "New antibody blocks protein receptor needed to infect human cells .\nPatients injected saw 300-fold reduction in amount of HIV in their blood .\nScientists believe breakthrough could result in new vaccines against virus ."}
{"document": "Bio security measures are being stepped up at Brisbane International Airport after mosquitoes that could potentially infect Australians with debilitating diseases were found on three separate occasions. Planes coming from South-East Asian countries are being routinely fumigated before luggage is removed after finding the exotic mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is responsible for an annual outbreak of dengue in North Queensland. The mozzie is known to carry crippling viruses like dengue, chikunguya and yellow fever. Aedes aegypti, known for its black and white stripes, can spread crippling diseases like dengue and chikunguya . The blood suckers, who are known for their black and white stripped legs, were discovered in the international baggage terminal on February 17, March 30 and again on March 31. Federal Minister for Agricultural Barnaby Joyce said there will be other measures to control the flying critters alongside fumigation, which include knockdown fogging, surface spraying, and treatment of standing water. Authorities said if the troublesome mosquitoes hadn't been detected they could have become a serious threat to the health of those living around the airport. Mr Joyce noted that tests were being carried out to narrow down exactly where the exotic insect came from. The blood suckers were discovered in the international terminal baggage on February 17, March 30 and again on March 31 . “This will allow us to better target our efforts to make sure none of these mosquitoes enter and establish in Australia—which could have a devastating impact on our human and animal health.' In February, authorities were forced to step up bio security at Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane airports after exotic mosquitoes were found in cargo holds. “There have been no further detections in Perth, Adelaide or Melbourne since the new measures were rolled out. This is a good result and it shows the flexibility of our risk-based bio security system—when risk increases so does our level of intervention,” Minister Joyce said. Exotic mosquitoes are a serious health concern for authorities because they are the primary transmitter of diseases like dengue. In February authorities were forced to step up bio security at Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane airports after exotic mosquitoes were found in cargo holds. Dengue fever can cause severe flu-like illnesses such as a fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, swollen glands or a rash. The virus is transmitted to humans when an infected female gives you a bite. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. Currently, the disease is prolific in more than 100 countries including Africa, the Americas, South-east Asia and the Western Pacific. While vaccinations are being developed there is no surefire way to stop people contracting the disease if mozzies in the area have been infected. Dengue fever can cause severe flu-like illnesses such as a fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, swollen glands or a rash. Chikunguya can also cause a terrible rash, swelling, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, nausea or vomiting . While dengue isn’t generally deadly WHO said it can cause deadly complications like fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding or organ impairment, which present with symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing and bleeding gums. Sixty-seven people in Queensland’s southeast contracted dengue fever this year however all cases were contracted while overseas.

{"document": "Captain Alastair Cook says England will leave Antigua with 'a bit of a downer on' after failing to force victory in the first Test against the West Indies. The tourists, chasing a first away win since beating India in December 2012, were halted by a stubbornly unresponsive pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, as well as a name-making century from all-rounder Jason Holder. In the end they could only muster five of the eight wickets they needed on day five as Holder's unbeaten 103 steered the hosts to 350 for seven. Alastair Cook holds his head in his hands after the chance to take a crucial wicket goes begging in Antigua . Cook stands next to West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin as both sides settled for a draw in the first Test . Cook did everything in his power to force the issue, rotating his bowlers, tinkering with fields and leaving close catchers in place from first ball to last. But in the end he was deflated, with just three days before the second Test in Grenada. 'I think the whole dressing room has a bit of a downer on because we left everything on the pitch, as we had to do,' he said. 'I wouldn't swap much of what we did on a pretty docile wicket, but credit to Holder because he soaked up a bit of pressure. 'I think you could start another Test match again on that wicket and it would last another five days. It didn't deteriorate at all but we came close to winning a Test match on it. Jason Holder hits a shot past cook on his way to his maiden Test century that earned his side a deserved draw . 'We threw everything at the West Indies, we played a pretty good Test match and came up just a little short. 'It was probably a points victory but we go to Grenada now.' England are unlikely to get much more assistance from the deck in St George's, though it could be more receptive to turn. That brings Moeen Ali into the equation, with the off-spinning all-rounder passed fit after an abdominal injury and linking up with the squad in Grenada. England will also be wary about over-burdening their seam bowlers in back to back Tests, but Cook was not ready to speculate on possible personnel changes. 'It's very tough to say without seeing Grenada and the wicket, but Mo is flying out and we'll see how he is,' said Cook. Devon Smith drives a shot past Cook on his way to 65 runs in a patient 175-ball second innings . 'Obviously when you do 130 overs in the dirt you need to see how the guys pull up.' England's task now is find a way to bowl their opponents out twice on flat Caribbean surfaces, a question that was already occupying James Anderson on the day he became the country's leading Test wicket-taker. 'For a fifth day pitch I've not seen many flatter. You expect a bit of deterioration but there was nothing,' said the seamer. 'I imagine that's what we'll get for the next two games too so we have to go away and think about ways to get 20 wickets in the next two games.' For all England's frustration, the West Indies will view the result as a morale boost. Captain Denesh Ramdin added: 'We haven't lost to England in Antigua before so it was nice to keep up that tradition. 'The draw will feel good, confidence is up and some of our batters have got good starts. 'So we regroup, come again and take it all to the next game.'

{"document": "(CNN)A term used by President Barack Obama and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to characterize rioters has given new life to a debate over the word \"thug.\" \"Of course it's not the right word, to call our children 'thugs,'\" Baltimore City Councilman Carl Stokes told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\"  \"These are children who have been set aside, marginalized, who have not been engaged by us.  No, we don't have to call them thugs.\" \"Just call them n-----s.  Just call them n-----s,\" he said.  \"No, we don't have to call them by names such as that.\" The Rev. Jamal Bryant drew the same comparison Wednesday morning on CNN.  The President and the mayor are wrong, he said.  \"These are not thugs, these are upset and frustrated children.\" \"It's amazing.  You don't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause 'thugs,' but children who are frustrated and don't have an outlet, you call them 'thugs.'  'Thugs' is the 21st century word for the n-word.  And it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what's taking place in this hour.\" The recent unrest in Baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody.  Six officers have been suspended over the incident.  Bryant delivered the eulogy at Gray's funeral. What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's death . Mayor Rawlings-Blake responded Wednesday. \"I wanted to clarify my comments on 'thugs,'\" she wrote Wednesday on Twitter.  \"When you speak out of frustration and anger, one can say things in a way that you don't mean.\" She added, \"That night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable, but who also need support. And my comments then didn't convey that.\" Kweisi Mfume, Baltimore native and former president of the NAACP, said, \"It's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty, despair, hunger, homelessness and a sense of not belonging.\" \"Whether we call them a thug, a law breaker, a juvenile delinquent, it really doesn't matter. What matters is how do we take back our streets. And that's what men have been doing, going around, talking to these young men where they, are in their face, and letting them know, you can't control this community. It is not yours. You can't burn it down. You can't force people out. You can't threaten people,\"  he told \"OutFront.\" \"So I understand that, that people want to talk about a word. But I'm more worried about a movement, and it's not necessarily a movement for positive change. It's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control.\" Kevin Shird, another Baltimore native and author of \"Lessons of Redemption,\" said \"thug\" is \"not like the n-word in my mind.\"  But, he said in a CNN interview, the term has \"been racialized across America, so I can see why people would become offended like that.\" Shird, a former drug dealer, also said he does not see the word as an accurate description of the young people who rioted and looted in Baltimore on Monday.  \"These were young juveniles. And so, in my mind I don't see a 16- or 17-year-old as a thug. I have seen thugs, and they don't look like thugs to me. My experience in life has been a little bit more extreme than that, but, again, it was criminal behavior and it can't be justified.\" He added, \"We just want to stay focused on the issue of police brutality and of the Freddie Gray matter.\" Opinion: Calling people 'thugs' solves nothing . NFL player Richard Sherman has previously called the term \"the accepted way of calling somebody the n-word nowadays.\" Rapper Slim Thug once addressed the term on the Houston radio program \"Madd Hatta Morning Show.\"  The host set up the exchange by referring to deceased rapper Tupac Shakur. \"I got the Tupac definition,\" the host said, as \"OutFront\" reported online in January 2014.  \"His is just, you know, a person going through struggles, has gone through struggles and continue to live day-by-day.... just trying to make it. \" \"I think the same thing,\" Slim Thug responded.  \"I probably got 'thug' off of him, you know, growing up listening to him... I feel the same way that he felt, coming from nothing to something.\" Webster's Dictionary defines \"thug\" as \"a brutal ruffian or assassin.\" On Monday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said, \"There is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests, those who wish to seek justice, those who wish to be heard, and want answers, and the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city.\" On Tuesday, President Obama referred to the rioters as \"a handful of criminals and thugs who tore up the place.\" That same day, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry used the word \"thugs\" to refer to ISIS.  At a luncheon in honor of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Kerry referred to two Japanese citizens \"who were murdered by the thugs of Daesh in retribution for Japan's pledge of humanitarian assistance -- I repeat, humanitarian assistance -- to the victims of fighting in the Middle East.\"  (Daesh is another term for ISIS.)

{"document": "Prince William is due at the Cenotaph on the same day the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth . Prince William is due to accompany the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on an official engagement next Saturday – the same day his wife is reportedly expected to give birth. Despite the clash, the Duke of Cambridge plans to do ‘everything he can’ to be at the official commemorations to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli and Anzac campaigns at the Cenotaph on April 25, Kensington Palace said yesterday. A spokesman for William said: ‘The Duke’s intention is to be at the commemorations. Being the 100th anniversary, it is very important to him.’ Although her due date has not officially been confirmed, the Duchess of Cambridge told wellwishers at a charity event last month: ‘I’m due mid-April, to the end of April.’ Palace sources later said the actual date was April 25. The Duke committed to being present at the commemorations in February and, according to aides, plans to play things by ear. ‘We will have to see what happens,’ said a senior aide. ‘The Duchess has said the baby is due the second half of the month but we don’t know exactly when the baby will arrive.’ Should Kate, 33, go into labour while the Duke is at work, he faces a dash across the country to get to St Mary’s Hospital in West London in time. He is currently training for his new job as an Air Ambulance pilot at three airbases in Cambridge, Norwich or Gloucestershire. Despite reports that there is a helicopter on stand-by, the Duke, 32, will make the journey by car instead. The Mail on Sunday has also learned there will be a new line-up in the delivery room at St Mary’s Lindo Wing for the couple’s second child. Leading obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston will be in charge of the birth, a spokesman for the couple confirmed, assisted by the Queen’s Surgeon-Gynaecologist Alan Farthing, who had been tipped to take the lead role. Mr Farthing was second-in-command to the now retired Sir Marcus Setchell at the birth of the Royal couple’s first child, George. William is currently training for his new job as an Air Ambulance pilot at three airbases in Cambridge, Norwich or Gloucestershire . ‘Both names will be on the notice of birth posted outside Buckingham Palace, but it will be Guy Thorpe-Beeston who will take charge,’ the spokesman added. ‘He’s an obstetrics specialist and that’s why he’s in the lead.’ Mr Thorpe-Beeston, a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, works at London’s private Portland Hospital and on Harley Street, where he has 18 years’ experience. He was made Surgeon-Gynaecologist to the Royal Household last year following his role in the delivery of George on July 22, 2013, also at the Lindo Wing. The consultant – who is believed to have looked after Kate when she was sick with hyperemesis gravidarum during her first trimester – will be the first person the Duchess calls when she goes into labour. He has cleared his diary so he can be solely on call. Mr Farthing, 51, who was engaged to TV presenter Jill Dando at the time of her murder, is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care. He has a private Harley Street practice. Mulberry double breasted pink coat . Sold out! Click to check out the current collection! Visit site .
