# DomainSum

## Introduction

DomainSum is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating the impact of domain shifts on abstractive summarization models.
- Includes five distinct domains at each level (genre, style, and topic).
- Constructed from high-quality public datasets.
- Eight key measures are employed to analyze the data distribution and summarization style shift characteristics.
- Seven popular PLMs and LLMs are evaluated on the benchmark in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.
- Models are evaluated across different domain shifts for future research references.
